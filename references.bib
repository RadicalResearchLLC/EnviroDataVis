  abstract = {Air pollution poses health concerns at the global scale. The challenge of managing air pollution is significant because of the many air pollutants, insufficient funds for monitoring and abatement programs, and political and social challenges in defining policy to limit emissions. Some governments provide citizens with air pollution health risk information to allow them to limit their exposure. However, many regions still have insufficient air pollution monitoring networks to provide real-time mapping. Where available, these risk mapping systems either provide absolute concentration data or the concentrations are used to derive an Air Quality Index, which provides the air pollution risk for a mix of air pollutants with a single value. When risk information is presented as a single value for an entire region it does not inform on the spatial variation within the region. Without an understanding of the local variation residents can only make a partially informed decision when choosing daily activities. The single value is typically provided because of a limited number of active monitoring units in the area. In our work, we overcome this issue by leveraging mobile air pollution monitoring techniques, meteorological information and land use information to map real-time air pollution health risks. We propose an approach that can provide improved health risk information to the public by applying neural network models within a framework that is inspired by land use regression. Mobile air pollution monitoring campaigns were conducted across Hamilton from 2005 to 2013. These mobile air pollution data were modelled with a number of predictor variables that included information on the surrounding land use characteristics, the meteorological conditions, air pollution concentrations from fixed location monitors, and traffic information during the time of collection. Fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide were both modelled. During the model fitting process we reserved twenty percent of the data to validate the predictions. The models' performances were measured with a coefficient of determination at 0.78 and 0.34 for PM2.5 and NO2, respectively. We apply a relative importance measure to identify the importance of each variable in the neural network to partially overcome the black box issues of neural network models.},

The dataset is an aggregation of several project specific monitoring days, which attempted to quantify air pollution spatial variation under varying conditions or in specific regions. Pollutants observed included carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, total nitrogen oxides, ground-level ozone, particulate matter concentrations for size cuts of 10 \&micro;m, 2.5 \&micro;m and 1 \&micro;m, and sulfur dioxide. Observations were collected over 114 days, which occurred in varying seasons and months. During sampling, the mobile platform travelled at an average speed of 27 km/h. The samples were collected as one-minute integrated samples and are prepared as line-segments, which include an offset for instrument response time. Sampling occurred on major freeways, highways, arterial and residential roads. This dataset is shared in hopes of supporting research on how to best utilize air pollution observations obtained with mobile air pollution platforms, which is a growing technique in the field of urban air pollution monitoring. We conclude with limitations in the data capture technique and recommendations for future mobile monitoring studies.},

The proposed system consists of a Mobile Data-Acquisition Unit (Mobile-DAQ) and a fixed Internet-Enabled Pollution Monitoring Server (Pollution-Server). The Mobile-DAQ unit integrates a single-chip microcontroller, air pollution sensors array, a General Packet Radio Service Modem (GPRS-Modem), and a Global Positioning System Module (GPS-Module). The Pollution-Server is a high-end personal computer application server with Internet connectivity. The Mobile-DAQ unit gathers air pollutants levels (CO, NO2, and SO2), and packs them in a frame with the GPS physical location, time, and date. The frame is subsequently uploaded to the GPRS-Modem and transmitted to the Pollution-Server via the public mobile network. A database server is attached to the Pollution-Server for storing the pollutants level for further usage by various clients such as environment protection agencies, vehicles registration authorities, and tourist and insurance companies. The Pollution-Server is interfaced to Google Maps to display real-time pollutants levels and locations in large metropolitan areas. The system was successfully tested in the city of Sharjah, UAE. The system reports real-time pollutants level and their location on a 24-h/7-day basis.},

  abstract = {This study investigated major sources of PM2.5 in the atmosphere of Kuwait based on a sampling program conducted between February 2004 and October 2005. Three source identification techniques were used in this study: (1) a positive matrix factorization model; (2) backward trajectory profiles; and (3) concentration rose plots. Five major sources of PM2.5 were estimated. These were sand dust (sand storms), oil combustion (power plants), petrochemical industry (fertilizer, nylon or catalyst regeneration facilities), traffic (vehicle emissions and road dust) and transported emissions (emissions from outside Kuwait, such as those from automobiles, road dust or smelters). The estimated contributions to PM2.5 of these sources were: 54\% from sand dust, 18\% from oil combustion, 12\% from petrochemical industry, 11\% from traffic and 5\% from anthropogenic sources transported from outside the country. Oil combustion, petrochemical industry and traffic were found to emanate from local sources, whereas sand dust and some emissions from traffic, and possibly smelters, appeared to originate from sources outside of Kuwait (transported). The PM2.5 levels in Kuwait during our previous sampling study averaged 53{$\mu$}g/m3. More than half of the measured PM2.5 appears to have been due to crustal material, much originating outside of the country. However, the relatively high levels of PM2.5 contributed by anthropogenic local sources, such as oil combustion, petrochemical industry emissions, and traffic indicated that there may be great opportunities for Kuwait to improve public health. The application of cost-effective emission controls and development of forward looking environmental health policies have the potential to significantly reduce emissions, population exposures to PM2.5 and the burden of mortality and morbidity from air pollution.},

  abstract = {A large number of vehicles routinely navigate through city streets; with on-board sensors, they can be transformed into a dynamic network that monitors the urban environment comprehensively and efficiently. In this paper, drive-by approaches are discussed as a form of mobile sensing, that offer a number of advantages over more traditional sensing approaches. It is shown that the physical properties of the urban environment that can be captured using drive-by sensing include ambient fluid, electromagnetic, urban envelope, photonic, and acoustic properties, which comprise the FEELS classification. In addition, the spatiotemporal variations of these phenomena are discussed as well as their implications on discrete-time sampling. The mobility patterns of sensor-hosting vehicles play a major role in drive-by sensing. Vehicles with scheduled trajectories, e.g., buses, and those with less predictable mobility patterns, e.g., taxis, are investigated for sensing efficacy in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. City Scanner is a drive-by approach with a modular sensing architecture, which enables cost-effective mass data acquisition on a multitude of city features. The City Scanner framework follows a centralized IoT regime to generate a near real-time visualization of sensed data. The sensing platform was mounted on top of garbage trucks and collected drive-by data for eight months in Cambridge, MA, USA. Acquired data were streamed to the cloud for processing and subsequent analyses. Based on a real-world application, we discuss and show the potential of using drive-by approaches to collect environmental data in urban areas using a variety of nondedicated land vehicles to optimize data collection in terms of spatiotemporal coverage.},

  abstract = {Air pollution affects billions of people worldwide, yet ambient pollution measurements are limited for much of the world. Urban air pollution concentrations vary sharply over short distances ({$\ll$}1 km) owing to unevenly distributed emission sources, dilution, and physicochemical transformations. Accordingly, even where present, conventional fixed-site pollution monitoring methods lack the spatial resolution needed to characterize heterogeneous human exposures and localized pollution hotspots. Here, we demonstrate a measurement approach to reveal urban air pollution patterns at 4\textendash 5 orders of magnitude greater spatial precision than possible with current central-site ambient monitoring. We equipped Google Street View vehicles with a fast-response pollution measurement platform and repeatedly sampled every street in a 30-km2 area of Oakland, CA, developing the largest urban air quality data set of its type. Resulting maps of annual daytime NO, NO2, and black carbon at 30 m-scale reveal stable, persistent pollution patterns with surprisingly sharp small-scale variability attributable to local sources, up to 5\textendash 8\texttimes{} within individual city blocks. Since local variation in air quality profoundly impacts public health and environmental equity, our results have important implications for how air pollution is measured and managed. If validated elsewhere, this readily scalable measurement approach could address major air quality data gaps worldwide.},

  abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rate of urban population growth in the world, with a large number of urban residents living in low-income ``slum'' neighborhoods. We conducted a study for an initial assessment of the levels and spatial and/or temporal patterns of multiple pollutants in the ambient air in two low-income neighborhoods in Accra, Ghana. Over a 3-week period we measured (i) 24-hour integrated PM10 and PM2.5 mass at four roof-top fixed sites, also used for particle speciation; (ii) continuous PM10 and PM2.5 at one fixed site; and (iii) 96-hour integrated concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at 30 fixed sites. We also conducted seven consecutive days of mobile monitoring of PM10 and PM2.5 mass and submicron particle count. PM10 ranged from 57.9 to 93.6~{$\mu$}g/m3 at the four sites, with a weighted average of 71.8~{$\mu$}g/m3 and PM2.5 from 22.3 to 40.2~{$\mu$}g/m3, with an average of 27.4~{$\mu$}g/m3. PM2.5/PM10 ratio at the four fixed sites ranged from 0.33 to 0.43. Elemental carbon (EC) was 10\textendash 11\% of PM2.5 mass at all four measurement sites; organic matter (OM) formed slightly less than 50\% of PM2.5 mass. Cl, K, and S had the largest elemental contributions to PM2.5 mass, and Cl, Si, Ca, Fe, and Al to coarse particles. SO2 and NO2 concentrations were almost universally lower than the US-EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), with virtually no variation across sites. There is evidence for the contributions from biomass and traffic sources, and from geological and marine non-combustion sources to particle pollution. The implications of the results for future urban air pollution monitoring and measurement in developing countries are discussed.},

Measurements indicated significant production of secondary OA (SOA), with enhancement ratio of OA with respect to carbon monoxide (CO) reaching 0.085{$\pm$}0.003 \textmu g m\textsuperscript{-3} ppbv\textsuperscript{-1}. At background mixing ratios of CO, up to {$\sim$} 1.8 \textmu g m\textsuperscript{-3} background OA was observed, suggesting significant non-combustion contribution to OA in the Front Range. The mean concentration of OA in plumes with a high influence of oil and natural gas (O\&amp;G) emissions was {$\sim$} 40 \% higher than in urban-influenced plumes. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) confirmed a dominant contribution of secondary, oxygenated OA (OOA) in the boundary layer instead of fresh, hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA). Combinations of primary OA (POA) volatility assumptions, aging of semi-volatile species, and different emission estimates from the O\&amp;G sector were used in the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulation scenarios. The assumption of semi-volatile POA resulted in greater than a factor of 10 lower POA concentrations compared to PMF-resolved HOA. Including top-down modified O\&amp;G emissions resulted in substantially better agreements in modeled ethane, toluene, hydroxyl radical, and ozone compared to measurements in the high-O\&amp;G-influenced plumes. By including emissions from the O\&amp;G sector using the top-down approach, it was estimated that the O\&amp;G sector contributed to \&lt; 5 \% of total OA, but up to 38 \% of anthropogenic SOA (aSOA) in the region. The best agreement between the measured and simulated median OA was achieved by limiting the extent of biogenic hydrocarbon aging and consequently biogenic SOA (bSOA) production. Despite a lower production of bSOA in this scenario, contribution of bSOA to total SOA remained high at 40\textendash 54 \%. Future studies aiming at a better emissions characterization of POA and intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) from the O\&amp;G sector are valuable.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Air quality models play an important role in providing information for verifying permitting conditions and for exposure assessment purposes. It is important to ensure traditional modeling approaches are applicable to perfluorinated compounds, which are known to have unusual properties. Measured field data were compared with modeling predictions to show that AERMOD adequately located the maximum air concentration in the study area, provided representative or conservative air concentration estimates, and demonstrated bias and scatter not significantly different than that reported for other compounds. Surface soil/grass concentrations resulting from modeled deposition flux also showed acceptable bias and scatter compared with measured concentrations of PFO in soil/grass samples. Errors in predictions of air concentrations or deposition may be best explained by meteorological input uncertainty and conservatism in the PRIME algorithm used to account for building downwash. In general, AERMOD was found to be a useful screening tool for modeling the dispersion and deposition of PFO in air near a manufacturing facility.},

  abstract = {In 2016, the Denver Metro Area (DMA)/Northern Colorado Front Range (NCFR) was reclassified from a Marginal to a Moderate O3 Non-Attainment Area due to the prevalence of high summer ozone (O3) occurrences. Hourly surface O3 data collected during 2000\textendash 2015 from a total of 80 monitoring sites in the State of Colorado were investigated for geographical features in O3 behavior and O3 changes over time. We particularly focus on summer O3 (June, July, August), which is the time when most exceedances of the O3 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) have been recorded. Variables investigated include the statistical (5th, 50th (median), and 95th percentile) distribution of O3 mixing ratios, diurnal amplitudes, and their trends. Trend analyses were conducted for 20 site records that had at least ten years of data. The majority of Colorado ozone monitoring sites show an increase of the 5th (16 total; 11 of these are statistically significant (p-value {$\leq$} 0.05) trends) and 50th (15 total; 4 statistically significant trends) percentile values. Changes for the 95th percentile values were smaller and less consistent. One site showed a statistically significant declining trend, and one site an increasing trend; the majority of other sites had slightly negative, albeit not statistically significant declining O3. Ozone changes at the two highest elevations sites (\&gt;2500 m asl) are all negative, contrasting increasing O3 at U.S. West Coast sites. NCFR urban sites do not show the rate of decreasing higher percentile O3 as seen for the majority of urban areas across the U.S. during the past 1\textendash 2 decades. The amplitudes of diurnal O3 cycles were studied as a proxy for nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and the diurnal O3 production chemistry. The majority of sites show a decrease in the median summer O3 diurnal amplitude (19 total/10 statistically significant). This is mostly driven by the increase in nighttime O3 minima, which is most likely a sign for a declining rate of nighttime O3 loss from titration with nitric oxide (NO), indicating a change in O3 behavior from declining NOx emissions. Since median and upper percentile surface O3 values in the DMA have not declined at the rates seen in other western U.S. regions, thus far the reduction in NOx has had a more pronounced effect on the lower percentile O3 distribution than on high O3 occurrences that primarily determine air quality. An assessment of the influence of oil and gas emissions on Colorado, and in particular DMA O3, is hampered by the sparsity of monitoring within oil and gas basins. Continuous, long-term, high quality, and co-located O3, NOx, and VOC monitoring are recommended for elucidating the geographical heterogeneity of O3 precursors, their changing emissions, and for evaluation of the effectiveness of O3 air quality regulations.},

To cope with this problem, in urban areas a ``monitor and react'' approach, based on measurements provided use of static monitoring stations, is commonly adopted introducing constrains to the amount of areas that can be monitored within the city. With the rise of the Internet of Things paradigm, new air monitoring models based on mobile sensors networks have been proposed. In this paper, we present the concept of Bus as a Sensor (BaaS): an air quality monitoring system based on mobile sensor nodes placed upon buses. This work aims to provide a high resolution air quality map to report pollutants measurements and facilitate the analysis to support the government decisions in order to reduce the pollution.

  abstract = {Railyards are important transportation hubs, and they are often situated near populated areas with high co-located density of manufacturing, freight movement and commercial enterprises. Emissions occurring within railyards can affect nearby air quality. To better understand the air pollution levels in proximity to a major railyard, an intensive mobile air monitoring study was conducted in May 2012 around a major railyard area in Atlanta, GA, constituted of two separate facilities situated side-by-side. A total of 19 multi-hour mobile monitoring sessions took place over different times of day, days of the week, and under a variety of wind conditions. High time resolution measurements included black carbon (BC), particle number concentration (PN), particle optical extinction (EXT), oxides of nitrogen (NO, NO2, NOy), carbon monoxide (CO), and speciated air toxics. Urban background was estimated to contribute substantially (\&gt;70\%) to EXT and CO, whereas BC, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and toluene had comparably low background contributions (\&lt;30\%). Mobile monitoring data were aggregated into 50 meter spatial medians by wind categories, with categories including low speed wind conditions (\&lt;0.5 m s\&minus;1) and, for wind speeds above that threshold, by wind direction relative to the railyard. Spatial medians of different pollutants measured had a wide range of correlation\&mdash;gas-phase air toxics (benzene, toluene, acetaldehyde) had moderate correlation with each other (r = 0.46\&ndash;0.59) and between toluene and CO (r = 0.53), but lower correlation for other pairings. PN had highest correlation with oxides of nitrogen (r = 0.55\&ndash;0.66), followed by BC (r = 0.4), and lower correlation with other pollutants. Multivariate regression analysis on the full set of 50 m medians found BC and NO as having the strongest relationship to railyard emissions, in comparison to their respective background levels. This was indicated by an increase associated with transiting through the yard and inverse relationship with distance from the railyard; NO and BC decreased by a factor of approximately 0.5 and 0.7 over 1 km distance of the railyard boundary, respectively. Low speed, variable wind conditions were related to higher concentrations of all measured parameters.},

This measurement strategy pushes the limits of traditional data analysis with complex second-by-second multipollutant data varying as a function of time and location. Data reduction and filtering techniques are often applied to deduce trends, such as pollutant spatial gradients downwind of a highway. However, rarely do mobile monitoring studies report the sensitivity of their results to the chosen data-processing approaches. The study being reported here utilized 40 h ({$>$} 140 000 observations) of mobile monitoring data collected on a roadway network in central North Carolina to explore common data-processing strategies including local emission plume detection, background estimation, and averaging techniques for spatial trend analyses. One-second time resolution measurements of ultrafine particles (UFPs), black carbon (BC), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO\textsubscript{2}) were collected on 12 unique driving routes that were each sampled repeatedly. The route with the highest number of repetitions was used to compare local exhaust plume detection and averaging methods. Analyses demonstrate that the multiple local exhaust plume detection strategies reported produce generally similar results and that utilizing a median of measurements taken within a specified route segment (as opposed to a mean) may be sufficient to avoid bias in near-source spatial trends. A time-series-based method of estimating background concentrations was shown to produce similar but slightly lower estimates than a location-based method. For the complete data set the estimated contributions of the background to the mean pollutant concentrations were as follows: BC (15\%), UFPs (26\%), CO (41\%), PM\textsubscript{2.5-10} (45\%), NO\textsubscript{2} (57\%), PM\textsubscript{10} (60\%), PM\textsubscript{2.5} (68\%). Lastly, while temporal smoothing (e.g., 5 s averages) results in weak pair-wise correlation and the blurring of spatial trends, spatial averaging (e.g., 10 m) is demonstrated to increase correlation and refine spatial trends.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {India faces one of the highest disease burdens from air pollution in the world, with an estimated 100\% of the population living in areas with PM2.5 concentrations above the World Health Organization Guideline (10\,{$\mu$}g/m3 annual average). With development and population growth, increases in ambient air pollution are anticipated. Combined with an aging population and increasing burden of chronic diseases, ambient air pollution will remain a concern for India well into the current century. Air quality measurements make critical contributions to the identification and prioritization of sources and locations of greatest concern, benchmarking against standards and guidelines, and in the evaluation of effectiveness of actions to reduce emissions. We compare the density of India's monitoring network with that of comparator countries and find large differences. For example, given the \textasciitilde 200 PM2.5 monitoring sites in operation during the 2010\textendash 2016 period, we find that India's monitor density of \textasciitilde 0.14 monitors/million persons (1 monitor for every 6.8 million people) is well below that of other highly populated countries such as China (1.2 monitors/million persons), the USA (3.4 monitors/million persons), Japan (0.5 monitors/million persons), Brazil (1.8) and most European countries (2\textendash 3 monitors/million persons). To address these gaps between India and monitor densities of comparator countries will require 1600\textendash 4000 monitors (1.2\textendash 3 monitors/million persons) at an estimated capital (annual operating) cost of US \$212\textendash 540 (\$106\textendash 270) million. Even at these densities, only relatively basic information on common air pollutants at high temporal, but limited spatial, resolution would be available. Small-scale variability in air pollution levels within urban areas would not be well-characterized, nor would there be information on chemical constituents useful for evaluating and improving simulations and forecasts, or for characterizing source contributions. As a sufficiently dense traditional network is developed over time, the potential for an integrated monitoring framework to serve as a near-term complement to a traditional network is assessed. In this design, a smaller number of traditional monitoring sites would be linked to a single advanced surface monitoring station in each of \textasciitilde 11 airsheds identified as a minimal number for India. These sites would combine measurement of chemical speciation of particulate matter with measurements of aerosol scatter and aerosol optical depth to link measurements with global and regional satellite-based estimates. In turn, the advanced and traditional sites could serve as calibration nodes for low-cost sensor networks designed to complement periodic mobile monitoring campaigns and/or land use regression models, to provide high spatial and temporal resolution. Such a framework could be established at a substantially reduced cost relative to that of a traditional networks, subject to specific design and complexity considerations. The same general approach may also be applicable to the many other countries with limited or no air quality monitoring and where estimates suggest air quality is a concern.},

  abstract = {Ambient surface ozone was monitored for one year at a series of seven sites along an elevation gradient from 1600~m to 3500~m above sea level (ASL) in Boulder County, Colorado. Spatial variability of ozone, quantified as the root mean squared deviation of hourly ozone per kilometer horizontal separation, decreased with elevation and distance from local sources, validating the assumption that (except at the City of Boulder (BO) site) the results of the study are representative of the Colorado Front Range. The northern hemisphere (NH) tropospheric spring ozone peak was clearly apparent in late April and early May and affected ozone at all~elevations. Ozone consistently increased with elevation during winter, with a mean monthly rate of 1.5~ppbv per 100~m elevation. In summer, this monotonic increase in ozone with elevation was not observed; instead mean monthly ozone increased in two steps, by {$\sim$}15~ppbv between 1610~m and 1940~m ASL and by {$\sim$}10~ppbv between 3350~m and 3530~m ASL to a maximum of 60~ppbv. The amplitude of the diurnal ozone cycle decreased with increasing elevation. Average summertime diurnal swings in ozone concentration had a magnitude of 29~ppbv at 1610~m ASL, and 7\textendash 16~ppbv at the mid-elevation sites. In~winter a diurnal cycle was observed only at the BO site, ozone concentrations at the remaining six locations changed on a multi-day timescale, indicating regional background behavior as the primary factor for wintertime ozone. Even the highest elevation site was influenced by transported urban air pollution in summer, indicated by the average 5~ppbv diurnal increase in ozone. Ozone exposure at the~mid- to high-elevation sites in many instances approached and exceeded the 8-h National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 75~ppbv. The elevated ozone levels along this transect were interpreted to be caused by the confounding effects of the high elevation of these sites, increased ozone in long-range transported air, and anthropogenic ozone production in air transported from the nearby urban and suburban areas east of the Colorado Front Range Mountains.},

Concentrations of six hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and black carbon (BC) from fossil fuel (BCff) were significantly higher at EJ communities versus non-EJ communities. BC from wood burning (BCwb) was significantly higher at non-EJ communities. Correlation analysis indicated that the six HAPs were predominantly from fossil fuel combustion sources, not from wood burning. The HAPs were moderately variable across sites (coefficient of divergence (COD) range of 0.07 for carbon tetrachloride to 0.28 for m- and p-xylenes), while BCff and BCwb were highly variable (COD values of 0.46 and 0.50). The BCwb was well correlated with levoglucosan (R2 of 0.68 to 0.95), indicating that BCwb was a robust indicator for wood burning. At the two permanent monitoring sites, wood burning comprised 29\&ndash;39\% of the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on nights when PM2.5 concentrations were forecasted to be high. Phone survey data were consistent with study measurements; the only significant difference in the survey results among communities were that non-EJ residents burn with indoor devices more often than EJ residents.},

Measurements at the surface and on a tower at 90 m were collected in Angiola, CA, from December 2000 through February 2001 and included hourly black carbon (BC), particle counts from optical particle counters, nitric oxide, ozone, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and direction. Boundary site measurements were made primarily using 24-hr integrated particulate matter (PM) samples. These measurements were used to understand the vertical variations of PM and PM precursors, the effect of stratification in the winter on concentrations and chemistry aloft and at the surface, and the impact of aloft-versus-surface transport on PM concentrations. Vertical variations of concentrations differed among individual species. The stratification may be important to atmospheric chemistry processes, particularly nighttime nitrate formation aloft, because NO2 appeared to be oxidized by ozone in the stratified aloft layer. Additionally, increases in accumulation-mode particle concentrations in the aloft layer during a fine PM (PM2.5) episode corresponded with increases in aloft nitrate, demonstrating the likelihood of an aloft nighttime nitrate formation mechanism. Evidence of local transport at the surface and regional transport aloft was found; transport processes also varied among the species. The distribution of BC appeared to be regional, and BC was often uniformly mixed vertically. Overall, the combination of time-resolved tower and surface measurements provided important insight into PM stratification, formation, and transport.},

This proximity to the hazards dashboard (PHD) places individual community members at the center of a cognitive frame. The PHD interface allows end-users to enter an address and identify the surrounding places of interest.

  abstract = {Cyclists' exposure to air pollutants near roadways has been associated with numerous health effects. While the adverse health effects concerning aerosols have traditionally been assessed with data of particle mass concentrations, it appears that the number concentration is also another important indicator of toxicity. Thus, to holistically evaluate one's exposure to aerosol particles, assessments should be based on mass concentrations and number concentrations. In order to assess individual cyclists' exposure as they move through space and time, spatiotemporal high-resolution approaches are needed. Therefore, a mobile, fast-response monitoring platform was developed that uses a cargo bicycle as a base. Data of particle mass concentrations (PM1, PM2.5, PM10) and particle number concentrations (PN10) were collected along two different routes, one characterized by high-intensity vehicle traffic and one by low-intensity vehicle traffic. While high spatiotemporal heterogeneity was observed for all measured quantities, the PN10 concentrations fluctuated the most. High concentrations of PN10 could be clearly associated with vehicle traffic. For PM2.5, this relation was less pronounced. Mean particle concentrations of all measures were significantly higher along the high-traffic route. Comparing route exposures, the inhalation of PM2.5 was similar between both routes, whereas along the high-traffic route, cyclists were exposed to twice the particle number. We conclude that the cargo bike, featuring high-frequency mobile measurements, was useful to characterize the spatial distribution of mass concentrations and number concentrations across an urban environment. Overall, our results suggest that the choice of route is a key factor in reducing cyclists' exposure to air pollution.},

Within each year from 2000 to 2008, the maxima of urban summer peaks were greater than winter peaks. However, from 2012 to 2015, the maxima of urban summertime PM2.5 peaks were smaller than the urban wintertime PM2.5 maxima, due to a decrease in the magnitude of summertime maxima with no corresponding decrease in the magnitude of winter maxima. PM2.5 measurements at rural sites displayed summer peaks with magnitudes relatively similar to those of urban sites, and negligible to no winter peaks through the time period analyzed. Seasonal variations of urban and rural PM2.5 sulfate, PM2.5 nitrate, and PM2.5 organic carbon (OC) were also assessed. Summer peaks in PM2.5 sulfate decreased dramatically between 2000 and 2015, whereas seasonal PM2.5 OC and winter PM2.5 nitrate concentration maxima remained fairly consistent. These findings demonstrate that PM2.5 concentrations, especially those occurring in the summertime, have declined in the U.S. from 2000 to 2015. In addition, reduction strategies targeting sulfate have been successful and the decrease in PM2.5 sulfate contributed to the decline in total PM2.5.},

Changes in available technology and subsequent increases in community-based participatory research (CBPR) have drastically improved the ability to address this issue. However, much still needs to be learned as these types of studies are expected to increase in the future. To assist, we review the literature in an effort to improve understanding of the motivations, approaches, and outcomes of air monitoring studies that incorporate CBPR and citizen science (CS) principles. We found that the primary motivations for conducting community-based air monitoring were concerns for air pollution health risks, residing near potential pollution sources, urban sprawl, living in ``unmonitored'' areas, and a general quest for improved air quality knowledge. Studies were mainly conducted using community led partnerships. Fixed site monitoring was primarily used, while mobile, personal, school-based, and occupational sampling approaches were less frequent. Low-cost sensors can enable thorough neighborhood level characterization; however, keeping the community involved at every step, understanding the limitations and benefits of this type of monitoring, recognizing potential areas of debate, and addressing study challenges are vital for achieving harmony between expected and observed study outcomes. Future directions include assessing currently unregulated pollutants, establishing long-term neighborhood monitoring sites, performing saturation studies, evaluating interventions, and creating CS databases.},

  abstract = {Modeling analyses were developed to evaluate near-road PM2.5 concentrations predicted by the AERMOD dispersion modeling chain under real-world conditions, and to assess the sensitivity of modeled near-road concentrations to the choice of dispersion model (AERMOD or CAL3QHCR), meteorological data, and travel data processing approach. We evaluate PM2.5 monitoring sites near major freeways in Indianapolis, Indiana (for 2016) and Providence, Rhode Island (for 2015\textendash 2016). The modeling analyses are built upon bottom-up estimates of temporally and spatially resolved roadway PM2.5 emissions based on traffic monitoring data and local vehicle fleet emission factors. The dispersion model simulations use local meteorological data collected at or close to the near-road monitoring sites. Predictions involved a modeling chain that included travel activity data processing, emissions modeling (MOVES and AP-42), and air quality dispersion modeling. We estimated the difference between PM2.5 concentrations at the near-road monitor and at nearby urban air quality monitoring sites (the measured near-road ``increment''), and compared modeled results to the measured increments. Based on monitoring data, estimates of multi-day-averaged near-road PM2.5 increments were 0.9~{$\pm~$}0.6~{$\mu$}g/m3 at Indianapolis and 1.4~{$\pm~$}0.2~{$\mu$}g/m3 at Providence (where the uncertainty represents the 95\% confidence interval on the mean value), and were comparable to measured PM2.5 increments at these sites in the near-road literature. Modeled roadway contributions to multi-day-averaged near-road concentrations substantially exceeded measured values based on the near-road monitoring data. The average near-road PM2.5 increment modeled with AERMOD was more than 300\% (factor of four) larger than the measured increment at Indianapolis, and more than 500\% (factor of six) larger than the measured increment at Providence. These biases reflect cumulative uncertainty throughout the near-road PM2.5 modeling chain. The emissions modeling component may have contributed to the modeling chain biases in two ways. First, the relative contribution of modeled non-exhaust emissions (PM2.5 brake wear, tire wear, and re-suspended road dust) compared to tailpipe exhaust emissions was higher than what has been documented in several published studies. Second, other research findings indicate that the U.S. EPA MOVES2014 model may over-predict tailpipe PM2.5 exhaust. The dispersion modeling component may have also contributed to the modeling chain biases. For example, when local meteorological data were used, AERMOD results were relatively insensitive to wind direction on a daily averaged basis; as a result, modeled concentrations exceeded measured values regardless of whether the near-road monitor was upwind or downwind of the roadway. In summary, this work provides a unique evaluation of PM2.5 concentrations predicted by the near-road modeling chain, and provides valuable information to understand potential sources of uncertainty in the near-road modeling process.},

Understanding where and when urban air pollutant concentrations peak is essential for effective air quality management and sustainable urban development. To this end, we implement a mobile monitoring methodology to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of particulate matter (PM) and black carbon (BC) throughout Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and use hot spot analysis and heatmaps to determine times and locations where pollutant concentrations are highest. Over the course of 12~days between June 27 and July 29, 2019, we measured air pollution concentrations continuously across two 150~mile (241.4~km) long routes. Average daily mean concentrations were 11.55 {$\pm$} 5.34~{$\mu$}g/m3 (PM1), 13.48 {$\pm$} 5.59~{$\mu$}g/m3 (PM2.5), 16.13 {$\pm$} 5.80~{$\mu$}g/m3 (PM10), and 1.56 {$\pm$} 0.39~{$\mu$}g/m3 (BC). We find that fine PM size fractions (PM2.5) constitute approximately 84\% of PM10 and that BC comprises 11.6\% of observed PM2.5. Air pollution hotspots across three size fractions of PM (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10) and BC had similar distributions throughout Philadelphia, but were most prevalent in the North Delaware, River Wards, and North planning districts. A plurality of detected hotspots found throughout the data collection period (30.19\%) occurred between the hours of 8:00 AM\textendash 9:00 AM.},

In this study, we employ a mobile monitoring method to collect PM2.5 and BC data in the city of Philadelphia, PA during the summer of 2019 and apply the Structure of Urban Landscapes (STURLA) methodology to examine relationships between urban structure and atmospheric pollution. We find that, while PM2.5 and BC vary by STURLA class, many of the differences in pollutant concentrations between classes are not significant. However, we also find that the proportions in which STURLA components are present throughout the urban landscape can be used to predict urban air pollution. Among frequently sampled STURLA classes, gpl hosted the highest PM2.5 concentrations on average (16.60 \&plusmn; 4.29 \&micro;g/m3), while tgbwp hosted the highest BC concentrations (2.31 \&plusmn; 1.94 \&micro;g/m3). Furthermore, STURLA combined with machine learning modeling was able to correlate PM2.5 (R2= 0.68, RMSE 2.82 \&micro;g/m3) and BC (R2 = 0.64, RMSE 0.75 \&micro;g/m3) concentrations with the urban landscape and spatially interpolate concentrations where sampling did not take place.

Since 1984 both fine ({$<$}2.5~{$\mu$}m \textendash{} PM2.5) and coarse (2.5\textendash 10~{$\mu$}m \textendash{} PM10\textendash 2.5) particle mass measurements have been made at NAPS network sites using dichotomous samplers. In January 2003, the NAPS PM2.5 speciation program was initiated with the purpose of measuring all major components of PM2.5, including ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, metals, and organic and elemental carbon. The present paper describes the improved sampling (e.g. Teflon/Nylon filter packs for nitrate loss, and an active blank for each and every sample in the determination of positive organic carbon artifacts), and analytical methods used in the Canadian NAPS PM2.5 speciation program. A detailed dataset was then analyzed for seasonal and geographical variations in the major components of 24-h time integrated PM2.5 samples collected at eight urban and three rural measurement sites across Canada (2003\textendash 2008). Chemical mass reconstruction was used for assessment of the adequacy of selected sampling and chemical parameters as well as for the determination of the relative contributions of different compound classes to PM2.5 mass. The highest frequency of PM2.5 episodes exceeding 30~{$\mu$}g~m-3 were observed in Ontario and southern Quebec. In general, the most important contributions to PM2.5 mass were secondary aerosol sulphate and nitrate (38\textendash 63\% for western sites and 3\textendash 44\% for eastern sites), depending on the season. Organic matter (OM) was found to be the second most important component (21\textendash 45\%), while particle-bound water (PBW) accounted for 6\textendash 12\% of the PM2.5 mass. Golden B.C. was an exception, exhibiting high levels of OM (60\textendash 70\%) and low levels of PBW ({$\sim$}3\%).},

  abstract = {With concern in recent years about adverse health effects for populations living or spending significant amounts of time near large roadways, an investigation of the air quality characteristics and potential sources influencing levels of PM and its chemical composition was undertaken in Toronto and Vancouver. Three near-road monitoring stations were established in the downtown area and beside a large highway in Toronto, and beside a major trucking route in Vancouver. 24-hour integrated samples were concurrently collected at these near-road and nearby urban background sites. This study has provided detailed chemical data for PM2.5 and reactive gases (NH3, HONO and HNO3) for a year in 2015\textendash 2016. Differences between pollutant concentrations at the near-road and background urban sites were identified, and compared with observations at other urban locations. The traffic contribution was quantified as the concentration increment between the near-road and background sites. The highest increments due to traffic were observed for elemental carbon, select trace metals (e.g. Fe, Ba, Cu, Sb, Zn) and reactive gases (NH3, HONO). In general, the percent contribution of local traffic-related emissions followed a descending order of Toronto highway\,{$>$}\,Vancouver truck route\,{$>$}\,downtown Toronto for most of these pollutants. It appears that the influence of traffic-related emissions on air pollution near roads depends more on the proportion of large trucks in the fleet than the total traffic volume. Application of principal component analysis (PCA) coupled with multi-linear regression (MLR) analysis to the local traffic increment pollutant data, as well as knowledge of chemical markers representative of different sources, helped to identify the possible sources of traffic-related PM2.5. These sources include non-exhaust (brake wear abrasion, resuspended road dust) and vehicular exhaust (mixed gasoline/diesel, diesel and lubricating oil combustion) emissions. The contribution of each of the sources varied between sites. In particular, the contribution of diesel exhaust emissions, presumably from highly polluting heavy-duty vehicles and trucks, was significant at the truck route (Vancouver) and the highway (Toronto) sites. Furthermore, the substantial contribution of non-exhaust emissions (brake wear and resuspension of road dust) to PM2.5, and thus metals, with differences between sites due to traffic characteristics or local meteorology was identified. Emissions related to lube oil combustion were not statistically significant. Overall, this work delivered valuable information that serves as input for further studies involving other roads and cities in order to generate reliable and representative results for air quality management and associated health outcomes.},

Twenty-six explicit PFAS compounds, including GenX, were added to CMAQ using current best estimates of air emissions and relevant physicochemical properties. The new model, CMAQ-PFAS, predicts that 5\% by mass of total emitted PFAS and 2.5\% of total GenX are deposited within {$\sim$}150 km of the facility, with the remainder transported out. Modeled air concentrations of total GenX and total PFAS around the facility can reach 24.6 and 8500 ng m\textendash 3 but decrease to {$\sim$}0.1 and {$\sim$}10 ng m\textendash 3 at 35 km downwind, respectively.

This work deals with modelling spatio-temporal air quality data, when multiple measurements are available for each space-time point. Typically this situation arises when different measurements referring to several response variables are observed in each space-time point, for example, different pollutants or size resolved data on particular matter. Nonetheless, such a kind of data also arises when using a mobile monitoring station moving along a path for a certain period of time. In this case, each spatio-temporal point has a number of measurements referring to the response variable observed several times over different locations in a close neighbourhood of the space-time point. We deal with this type of data within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, in which observed measurements are modelled in the first stage of the hierarchy, while the unobserved spatio-temporal process is considered in the following stages. The final model is very flexible and includes autoregressive terms in time, different structures for the variance-covariance matrix of the errors, and can manage covariates available at different space-time resolutions. This approach is motivated by the availability of data on urban pollution dynamics: fast measures of gases and size resolved particulate matter have been collected using an Optical Particle Counter located on a cabin of a public conveyance that moves on a monorail on a line transect of a town. Urban microclimate information is also available and included in the model. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model over existing alternatives that do not model data over the first stage of the hierarchy.},

Elevated air pollution concentrations near these types of sources have been linked to adverse health effects including acute and chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Mobile monitoring has proven to be a useful technique to characterize spatial variability of air pollution in urban areas and pollution concentration gradients from specific sources. A study was conducted in the Kansas City, Kansas (USA) metropolitan area using mobile monitoring to characterize the spatial variability and gradients of air pollutants to identify the contribution of multiple sources on community-level air quality in a complex urban environment. Measurements focused on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black carbon (BC), and ultrafine particulate matter (UFP). Mobile monitoring showed that median concentrations of these pollutants ranged by up to a factor of three between the communities, with individual measurements ranging over an order of magnitude within the community. Evaluating these air quality measurements with wind direction data highlighted the influence of specific and combinations of air pollution sources on these elevated concentrations, which can provide valuable information to environmental and public health officials in prioritizing and implementing cost-effect air quality management strategies to reduce exposures for urban populations.},

However, there is a dearth of measurements due to the high cost of standard reference instruments. Mobile AQM using low-cost sensors deployed on routine fleets of vehicles can enable the continuous detection of fine-scale pollutant variations in cities at a lower cost. New methods need to be developed to interpret these measurements. This paper presents three such methods. First, we propose a technique to identify aerosol hotspots. Second, we employ techniques published previously to assess the generalizable map of fine and coarse particle number concentrations, to understand qualitatively the contribution of local and regional sources across the region sampled. By using the raw number concentration of differently sized particles from the Optical Particle Counters (OPCs) instead of the noisier mass concentrations, we obtain more robust results. Third, in order to evaluate source signatures in cities, we propose another technique, in which we cluster the entire range of aerosol size-distribution measurements acquired. The properties of each cluster provide insight into the aerosol source characteristics in the sampling environment. We test these methods using a dataset we collected by mounting OPCs on two trash-trucks in Cambridge, Massachusetts.},

It is important to understand factors that contribute to the variability of exposures during commutes to develop strategies to mitigate exposure. We used low-cost Fairsense PMS1003 sensors to monitor exposure to multiple air pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, O3 and NO2, across four dominant transport modes: bike, taxi, subway and bus, on prescribed commuting routes covering a wide range of environments representative of downtown Zhengzhou during the morning and evening rush hours. Zhengzhou is a city in China that faces severe air quality challenges. We compared exposures in the different modes and evaluated factors that contributed to variability in exposure to the different pollutants during commute trips. There were statistically significant differences in exposures across commuting modes for most pollutants. Commuting in air-conditioned taxis had the lowest exposure to PM, but highest exposures to some primary gaseous pollutants (SO2 and CO). In a multivariate analysis, the travel mode generally explained the greatest variability in pollutant exposure, in comparison to route, time of day (morning/evening), and background pollutant concentrations.

  abstract = {The temporary decrease of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in many parts of the world due to the COVID-19 lockdown spurred discussions on urban air pollution and health. However there has been little focus on sub-Saharan Africa, as few African cities have air quality monitors and if they do, these data are often not publicly available. Spatial differentials of changes in PM2.5 concentrations as a result of COVID also remain largely unstudied. To address this gap, we use a serendipitous mobile air quality monitoring deployment of eight Sensirion SPS 30 sensors on motorbikes in the city of Nairobi starting on 16 March 2020, before a COVID-19 curfew was imposed on 25 March and continuing until 5 May 2020. We developed a random-forest model to estimate PM2.5 surfaces for the entire city of Nairobi before and during the COVID-19 curfew. The highest PM2.5 concentrations during both periods were observed in the poor neighborhoods of Kariobangi, Mathare, Umoja, and Dandora, located to the east of the city center. Changes in PM2.5 were heterogeneous over space. PM2.5 concentrations increased during the curfew in rapidly urbanizing, the lower-middle-class neighborhoods of Kahawa, Kasarani, and Ruaraka, likely because residents switched from LPG to biomass fuels due to loss of income. Our results indicate that COVID-19 and policies to address it may have exacerbated existing air pollution inequalities in the city of Nairobi. The quantitative results are preliminary, due to sampling limitations and measurement uncertainties, as the available data came exclusively from low-cost sensors. This research serves to highlight that spatial data that is essential for understanding structural inequalities reflected in uneven air pollution burdens and differential impacts of events like the COVID pandemic. With the help of carefully deployed low-cost sensors with improved spatial sampling and at least one reference-quality monitor for calibration, we can collect data that is critical for developing targeted interventions that address environmental injustice in the African context.},

Over 22 months, integrated and continuous rooftop particulate matter (PM) monitors were placed at a total of 11 residential or roadside monitoring sites in four neighborhoods of varying SES and biomass fuel use. PM concentrations were highest in late December and January, due to dust blown from the Sahara. Excluding this period, annual PM2.5 ranged from 39 to 53 {$\mu$}g/m3 at roadside sites and 30 to 70 {$\mu$}g/m3 at residential sites; mean annual PM10 ranged from 80 to 108 {$\mu$}g/m3 at roadside sites and 57 to 106 {$\mu$}g/m3 at residential sites. The low-income and densely populated neighborhood of Jamestown/Ushertown had the single highest residential PM concentration. There was less difference across traffic sites. Daily PM increased at all sites at daybreak, followed by a mid-day peak at some sites, and a more spread-out evening peak at all sites. Average carbon monoxide concentrations at different sites and seasons ranged from 7 to 55 ppm, and were generally lower at residential sites than at traffic sites. The results show that PM in these four neighborhoods is substantially higher than the WHO Air Quality Guidelines and in some cases even higher than the WHO Interim Target 1, with the highest pollution in the poorest neighborhood.},

  abstract = {Walking School Buses (WSBs) provide a safe alternative to being driven to school. Children benefit from the contribution the exercise provides towards their daily exercise target, it gives children practical experience with respect to road safety and it helps to relieve traffic congestion around the entrance to their school. Walking routes are designed largely based in road safety considerations, catchment need and the availability of parent support. However, little attention is given to the air pollution exposure experienced by children during their journey to school, despite the commuting microenvironment being an important contributor to a child's daily air pollution exposure. This study aims to quantify the air pollution exposure experienced by children walking to school and those being driven by car. A school was chosen in Bradford, UK. Three adult participants carried out the journey to and from school, each carrying a P-Trak ultrafine particle (UFP) count monitor. One participant travelled the journey to school by car while the other two walked, each on opposite sides of the road for the majority of the journey. Data collection was carried out over a period of two weeks, for a total of five journeys to school in the morning and five on the way home at the end of the school day. Results of the study suggest that car commuters experience lower levels of air pollution dose due to lower exposure and reduced commute times. The largest reductions in exposure for pedestrians can be achieved by avoiding close proximity to traffic queuing up at intersections, and, where possible, walking on the side of the road opposite the traffic, especially during the morning commuting period. Major intersections should also be avoided as they were associated with peak exposures. Steps to ensure that the phasing of lights is optimised to minimise pedestrian waiting time would also help reduce exposure. If possible, busy roads should be avoided altogether. By the careful design of WSB routes, taking into account air pollution, children will be able to experience the benefits that walking to school brings while minimizing their air pollution exposure during their commute to and from school.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, new and emerging technologies in air pollution instrumentation have made it possible to involve students and citizen scientists in air pollution monitoring. Similarly, advances in data communication and transmission have made it increasingly easy to share and graphically display data. Two educational programs, the Global Ozone (GO3) Project and AQTreks, have used these advances to get air pollution monitors into the hands of thousands of students around the world and to automate data sharing. The pilot project for AQTreks, GO3 Treks, is also discussed. These educational projects began in 2009 with the GO3 Project, a stationary ground-level ozone monitoring project. In the GO3 Project, students and teachers at more than 100 schools from around the world installed ozone and weather monitoring stations at their schools with automatic uploading of their data every 15\,min, resulting in more than 12 million ozone measurements along with associated weather data. Over the years, new technologies became available for students to expand their measurements from stationary to mobile platforms. Since 2016, the AQTreks educational program has been developed concurrently with the Personal Air Monitor (PAM), a mobile sensor suite paired with a smartphone app. Complementing the technology are online curricula and other resources for students and citizens to learn about air pollution and climate change. In these projects, a focus on data quality and the careful selection of monitoring technologies have resulted in scientific use of the student-collected data, including their incorporation in several research campaigns that have furthered understanding of ground-level ozone formation. This approach has demonstrated the utility of these types of educational programs both in terms of furthering scientific research and educating the next generation about air quality issues.},

Our results are based on a mobile data collection campaign conducted in 2012 in Montreal, Canada using instrumented bicycles and covering approximately 475~km of unique roadways. The spatial extent of the data collected included a diverse array of roads and land use patterns. Average concentrations of UFP per roadway segment varied greatly across the study area (1411\textendash 192,340 particles/cm3) as well as across the different visits to the same segment. Mixed effects linear regression models were estimated for UFP (R2~=~43.80\%), incorporating a wide range of predictors including land-use, built environment, road characteristics, and meteorology. Temperature and wind speed had a large negative effect on near-road concentrations of UFP. Both the day of the week and time of day had a significant effect with Tuesdays and afternoon periods positively associated with UFP. Since UFP are largely associated with traffic emissions and considering the wide spatial extent of our data collection campaign, it was impossible to collect traffic volume data. For this purpose, we used simulated data for traffic volumes and speeds across the region and observed a positive effect for volumes and negative effect for speed. Finally, proximity to truck routes was also associated with higher UFP concentrations.},

Contrasting O\textsubscript{3} distributions were observed in the winters of 2011 and 2012, with numerous episodes (hourly O\textsubscript{3} \&ge; 85 ppbv) in 2011 compared to none in 2012. The lack of O\textsubscript{3} episodes in 2012 coincided with a reduction in measured ambient levels of total non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC). Measurements of speciated NMHC, and other air quality parameters, were performed to better understand emission sources and to determine which compounds are most active in promoting O\textsubscript{3} formation. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analyses of the data were carried out to help achieve these goals. PMF analyses revealed three contributing factors that were identified with different emission source types: factor 1, combustion/traffic; factor 2, fugitive natural gas; and factor 3, fugitive condensate. Compositional signatures of the three contributing factors were identified through comparison with independently derived emission source profiles. Fugitive emissions of natural gas and of condensate were the two principal emission source types for NMHC. A water treatment and recycling facility was found to be a significant source of NMHC that are abundant in condensate, in particular toluene and \emph{m}+\emph{p}-xylene. Emissions from water treatment have an influence upon peak O\textsubscript{3} mixing ratios at downwind measurement sites.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Measured concentrations are compared with ambient air quality guidelines from Canadian jurisdictions, and compounds that exceeded guidelines are identified and discussed. Although this study does not assess risk or cumulative effects, air toxics that approached guidelines are also identified so that their potential contribution to ambient air toxics pollution can be considered. Eleven air toxics exceeded at least one guideline, and an additional 16 approached guidelines during the study period. Four compounds were measured using methods whose detection limits exceeded a guideline value, three of which could not be compared with guidelines, since they were not detected in any samples. The assessment of several metal(loid) concentrations is tentative, since they were measured only in fine particulate matter (PM) but compared with guidelines based on coarse or total PM. Improvements to sampling and analysis techniques for the latter compounds as well as for those whose methods are subject to known uncertainties would improve confidence in reported concentrations and their relation to applicable guidelines. Analysis of sampling strategies for all compounds found to exceed or approach guidelines would contribute to ensuring that their spatiotemporal coverage is adequate. Examination of the air toxics not measured by NAPS but having guidelines in Canadian jurisdictions or being included in other programs such as the U.S. National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) would contribute to ensuring that the full suite of pollutants relevant to ambient air quality in Canada is subject to adequate study.

To determine how the urban form and meteorology influence the air pollution distribution at a neighborhood scale (2~km*2~km), we performed a fine-scale investigation of a typical air pollutant (i.e., PM2.5) by mobile measurements in two communities in the inner and outer cities of Shanghai, China. The PM2.5 mass concentrations and potential impacting factors, such as PM2.5 background levels, road networks, traffic volumes, meteorological parameters, building heights and land use types, were collected at a 10\,m spatial resolution, and their relationships were analyzed using both a generalized additive model (GAM) and land use regression (LUR). The modeling results showed that the GAM outperformed LUR in both study areas, with a higher adjusted R2 and a lower RMSE. The PM2.5 was found to have drastic variations at the neighborhood scale, which was primarily driven by spatial patterns of the PM2.5 background levels and traffic volumes. The GAM-based PM2.5 concentration surface clearly disclosed the heterogeneous variation of the PM2.5 mass concentrations in each community, and demonstrated the prominent influence from the nearby highway, especially in the central urban area. This study provides the first empirical evidence of the exposure heterogeneity of the air pollution on a neighborhood scale, which can assist planners and policymakers in evaluating planning strategies with a full consideration of reducing local air pollution.},

  abstract = {On-road emissions vary widely on time scales as short as minutes and length scales as short as tens of meters. Detailed data on emissions at these scales are a prerequisite to accurately quantifying ambient pollution concentrations and identifying hotspots of human exposure within urban areas. We construct a highly resolved inventory of hourly fluxes of CO, NO2, NOx, PM2.5 and CO2 from road vehicles on 280,000 road segments in eastern Massachusetts for the year 2012. Our inventory integrates a large database of hourly vehicle speeds derived from mobile phone and vehicle GPS data with multiple regional datasets of vehicle flows, fleet characteristics, and local meteorology. We quantify the `excess' emissions from traffic congestion, finding modest congestion enhancement (3\textendash 6\%) at regional scales, but hundreds of local hotspots with highly elevated annual emissions (up to 75\% for individual roadways in key corridors). Congestion-driven reductions in vehicle fuel economy necessitated `excess' consumption of 113 million gallons of motor fuel, worth~{$\sim~\$$}415M, but this accounted for only 3.5\% of the total fuel consumed in Massachusetts, as over 80\% of vehicle travel occurs in uncongested conditions. Across our study domain, emissions are highly spatially concentrated, with 70\% of pollution originating from only 10\% of the roads. The 2011 EPA National Emissions Inventory (NEI) understates our aggregate emissions of NOx, PM2.5, and CO2 by 46\%, 38\%, and 18\%, respectively. However, CO emissions agree within 5\% for the two inventories, suggesting that the large biases in NOx and PM2.5 emissions arise from differences in estimates of diesel vehicle activity. By providing fine-scale information on local emission hotspots and regional emissions patterns, our inventory framework supports targeted traffic interventions, transparent benchmarking, and improvements in overall urban air quality.},

  abstract = {Background: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning technique that has been applied successfully in several fields, including signal processing, face recognition and text mining. Recent applications of NMF in bioinformatics have demonstrated its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays. Developments in NMF theory and applications have resulted in a variety of algorithms and methods. However, most NMF implementations have been on commercial platforms, while those that are freely available typically require programming skills. This limits their use by the wider research community. Results: Our objective is to provide the bioinformatics community with an open-source, easy-to-use and unified interface to standard NMF algorithms, as well as with a simple framework to help implement and test new NMF methods. For that purpose, we have developed a package for the R/BioConductor platform. The package ports public code to R, and is structured to enable users to easily modify and/or add algorithms. It includes a number of published NMF algorithms and initialization methods and facilitates the combination of these to produce new NMF strategies. Commonly used benchmark data and visualization methods are provided to help in the comparison and interpretation of the results. Conclusions: The NMF package helps realize the potential of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, especially in bioinformatics, providing easy access to methods that have already yielded new insights in many applications. Documentation, source code and sample data are available from CRAN.},

The analysis studies how visualizations may contribute to confirmation, disintegration, integration, or polarization of discourse coalitions due to similarities or differences between visual and discursive storylines.

We define a VDC as a network of actors that share a similar discursive storyline and a similar visual storyline of the controversy.

For these reasons, in the last decade we assisted to a continuously increasing interest in the mobile monitoring of PM on a regional and a local scale. Here we summarize the current status in this field, outlining the critical issues and the perspectives. The growing availability of instruments designed and optimized to the real-time monitoring of the air quality, considerably increased the spatial and temporal resolution of available datasets, actually improving air pollution maps and forecast models. However, several issues are still unresolved, particularly in terms of data representativeness. Indeed, the future PM monitoring devices have to be designed to support the decisional process but also the management of environmental emergencies in urban and industrial areas. The future of these devices is certainly the development of compact systems that will make possible a real-time characterization of size distribution, morphology, and chemical composition of the airborne particles.},

To address this issue, we review the main principles of visualisation, discuss specific graphical challenges for environmental science and highlight some best practice from non-professional contexts. We provide a design framework to enhance the communication and application of scientific information within professional contexts. These guidelines can help scientists incorporate effective visualisations within improved dissemination and knowledge exchange platforms. We conclude that the uptake of science within environmental decision-making requires a highly iterative and collaborative design approach towards the development of tailored visualisations. This enables users to not only generate actionable understanding but also explore information on their own terms.},

  abstract = {Cycling and walking are being promoted in many urban areas as alternatives to motorised transport for health, environmental, and financial reasons. The reduced congestion and resulting decrease in the overall amount of pollution reduced can be expected to result in health benefits for the community. However, active commuters, due to their increased respiration rates and often increased travel times can expect to receive larger doses of air pollution compared with those using motorised forms of transport. However, given the large dropoff in concentrations away from a road, it can be expected that significant reductions can be achieved even with relatively small increases in separation between the path of cyclists/pedestrians and motor vehicles. This study presents a simple methodology for calculating the separation needed for cyclists and pedestrians to experience the same air pollution dose as car commuters. An example is given based on carbon monoxide (CO) data collected in a field campaign consisting of a car driver, a cyclist and a pedestrian travelling on a 2600 metre loop of road in Auckland. For this case study, the estimated distance from the centreline needed for cyclists and pedestrians to receive an equivalent dose of CO as motorists was found to range from 5.8 to 14.2m depending on the commuting mode and the dispersion state of the atmosphere at the site. This was equal to a CO concentration reduction of 0.1\textendash 0.14ppm per metre. Recommendations on facility modifications and route selections have been made to make active mode commuting safer.},

Vehicles traveling on arterial roadways may also contribute to air pollution spatial variability in urban areas. To characterize the nature of near-road air quality in a complex urban environment, an instrumented all-electric vehicle was deployed to perform high spatial- and temporal-resolution mapping of ultra-fine particles (UFPs, particle diameter {$<$}100 nm) and carbon monoxide (CO). Sampling was conducted in areas surrounding a highway in Durham, NC, with multiple repeats of the driving route accomplished within a morning or evening commute time frame. Six different near-road transects were driven, which included features such as noise barriers, vegetation, frontage roads, and densely built houses. Under downwind conditions, median UFP and CO levels in near-road areas located 20\textendash 150 m from the highway were a factor of 1.8 and 1.2 higher, respectively, than in areas characterized as urban background. Sampling in multiple near-road neighborhoods during downwind conditions revealed significant variability in absolute UFP and CO concentrations as well as in the rate of concentration attenuation with increasing distance from the highway. During low-speed meandering winds, regional UFP and CO concentrations nearly doubled relative to crosswind conditions; however, near-road UFP levels were still higher than urban background levels by a factor of 1.2, whereas near-road CO concentrations were not significantly different than the urban background.},

We use bicycle-based, mobile measurements ({$\sim$}85 h) during rush-hour in Minneapolis, MN to build LUR models for particulate concentrations (particle number [PN], black carbon [BC], fine particulate matter [PM2.5], particle size). We developed and examined 1224 separate LUR models by varying pollutant, time-of-day, and method of spatial and temporal smoothing of the time-series data. Our base-case LUR models had modest goodness-of-fit (adjusted R2: {$\sim$}0.5 [PN], {$\sim$}0.4 [PM2.5], 0.35 [BC], {$\sim$}0.25 [particle size]), low bias ({$<$}4\%) and absolute bias (2-18\%), and included predictor variables that captured proximity to and density of emission sources. The spatial density of our measurements resulted in a large model-building data set (n = 1101 concentration estimates); {$\sim$}25\% of buffer variables were selected at spatial scales of {$<$}100m, suggesting that on-road particle concentrations change on small spatial scales. LUR model-R2 improved as sampling runs were completed, with diminishing benefits after {$\sim$}40 h of data collection. Spatial autocorrelation of model residuals indicated that models performed poorly where spatiotemporal resolution of emission sources (i.e., traffic congestion) was poor. Our findings suggest that LUR modeling from mobile measurements is possible, but that more work could usefully inform best practices.},

We developed (1) daytime (12-h average) models that approximate long-term concentrations and (2) spatiotemporal models for estimating hourly concentrations. Model performance for the daytime models is consistent with previous fixed-site and short-term sampling studies; adjusted R2 (10-fold CV R2) was 0.80 (0.69) for the PN model and 0.67 (0.58) for the BC model. The spatiotemporal models had comparable performance (10-fold CV R2 for the PN [BC] models: 0.42 [0.25]) to previous mobile monitoring studies that isolate specific time periods. Temporal and spatial model coefficients had similar magnitudes in the spatiotemporal models suggesting both factors are important for exposure.

In particular, ultrafine particles (UFPs) are widely spread in urban environments and may have a severe impact on human health. However, the lack of knowledge about the spatio-temporal distribution of UFPs hampers profound evaluation of these effects. In this paper, we analyze one of the largest spatially resolved UFP data set publicly available today containing over 50 million measurements. We collected the measurements throughout more than two years using mobile sensor nodes installed on top of public transport vehicles in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Based on these data, we develop land-use regression models to create pollution maps with a high spatial resolution of 100~m~\texttimes ~100~m. We compare the accuracy of the derived models across various time scales and observe a rapid drop in accuracy for maps with sub-weekly temporal resolution. To address this problem, we propose a novel modeling approach that incorporates past measurements annotated with metadata into the modeling process. In this way, we achieve a 26\% reduction in the root-mean-square error\textendash a standard metric to evaluate the accuracy of air quality models\textendash of pollution maps with semi-daily temporal resolution. We believe that our findings can help epidemiologists to better understand the adverse health effects related to UFPs and serve as a stepping stone towards detailed real-time pollution assessment.},

Despite the increasing capability of simulating snowpack conditions with physical models, models have seen limited adoption by avalanche forecasters. Feedback from forecasters suggests that model data are presented in ways that are difficult to interpret and irrelevant to operational needs. We apply a visualization design framework to enhance the value of snowpack models to avalanche forecasters. An established risk-based avalanche forecasting workflow is used to define the ways forecasters solve problems with snowpack data. We suggest that model data be visualized in ways that directly support common forecasting tasks such as identifying snowpack features related to avalanche problems and locating avalanche problems in terrain at relevant spatial scales. Examples of visualizations that support these tasks and follow established perceptual and cognitive principles from the field of information visualization are presented. Interactive designs play a critical role in understanding these complex datasets and are well suited for forecasting workflows. Although extensive user testing is still needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these designs, visualization design principles open the door to more relevant and interpretable applications of snowpack model for avalanche forecasters. This work sets the stage for implementing snowpack models into visualization tools where forecasters can test their operational value and learn their capabilities and deficiencies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Fixed-station monitors, typically operated by governments, offer accurate but sparse data, and are increasingly being augmented by lower fidelity but denser measurements taken by mobile sensors carried by concerned citizens and researchers. In this paper, we introduce HazeEst-a machine learning model that combines sparse fixed-station data with dense mobile sensor data to estimate the air pollution surface for any given hour on any given day in Sydney. We assess our system using seven regression models and tenfold cross validation. The results show that estimation accuracy of support vector regression (SVR) is similar to decision tree regression and random forest regression, and higher than extreme gradient boosting, multi-layer perceptrons, linear regression, and adaptive boosting regression. The air pollution estimates from our models are validated via field trials, and results show that SVR not only yields high spatial resolution estimates that correspond well with the pollution surface obtained from fixed and mobile sensor monitoring systems, but also indicates boundaries of polluted area better than other regression models. Our results can be visualized using a Web-based application customized for metropolitan Sydney. We believe that the continuous estimates provided by our system can better inform air pollution exposure and its impact on human health.},

  abstract = {Source apportionment of 24\textendash hour integrated PM2.5 chemical speciation data, collected at five Canadian urban sites, Windsor, Toronto, Montreal, Halifax, and Edmonton was performed using the receptor model, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). In order to determine the influences of local and regional sources, in\textendash depth wind direction and back trajectory analyses were performed using the conditional probability function (CPF) and the potential source contribution function (PSCF). The highest PM2.5 levels were observed in Windsor followed by Toronto and Montreal. Secondary sulfate and nitrate were the major factors contributing to the PM2.5 mass, accounting for 41\% \textendash{} 61\% in the five sites. These secondary factors were associated with trans\textendash boundary emissions from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. An elemental carbon (EC)\textendash rich factor was identified in Windsor, Toronto, and Montreal, characterized by distinct EC and organic carbon (OC) profiles. The EC\textendash rich factor accounted for 6\% \textendash{} 19\% of the total PM2.5 mass in summer and also appeared to be related to trans-boundary pollutants. The combined contributions of traffic and road dust ranged from 14\% to 19\%, with a portion of the nitrate factor also coming from vehicles. In Halifax, sea salt was the second strongest source, contributing 18\% of the PM2.5. In Edmonton, strong correlation of volatile organic compounds with the major PM2.5 factors suggested that local industrial sources were significant sources of secondary aerosol. Further, biomass burning contributed 12\% of the PM2.5 mass in Edmonton. Both local and regional sources were found to contribute at all sites. Thus, PM2.5 can be reduced at all the sites through local controls. However given the significant contribution of trans\textendash boundary contributions to the PM2.5 mass, a substantial reduction of PM2.5 in four of the cities will also require agreements to limit the production and transport of trans\textendash boundary pollutants.},

The overall high levels of urban air pollution have been shown to be of a significant risk to city dwellers. However, the impacts of very high but temporally and spatially restricted pollution, and thus exposure, are still poorly understood. Conventional approaches to air quality monitoring are based on networks of static and sparse measurement stations. However, these are prohibitively expensive to capture tempo-spatial heterogeneity and identify pollution hotspots, which is required for the development of robust real-time strategies for exposure control. Current progress in developing low-cost micro-scale sensing technology is radically changing the conventional approach to allow real-time information in a capillary form. But the question remains whether there is value in the less accurate data they generate. This article illustrates the drivers behind current rises in the use of low-cost sensors for air pollution management in cities, while addressing the major challenges for their effective implementation.},

Conventional LUR requires long-term measurements at multiple locations, so application to particulate matter has been limited. Here we use mobile monitoring to characterize spatial variability in black carbon concentrations for LUR modeling. A particle soot absorption photometer in a moving vehicle was used to measure the absorption coefficient ({$\sigma$}ap) during summertime periods of peak afternoon traffic at 39 locations. LUR was used to model the mean and 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile values of the distribution of 10 s measurements at each location. Model performance (measured by R2) was higher for the 25th and 50th percentiles (0.72 and 0.68, respectively) than for the mean, 75th and 90th percentiles (0.51, 0.55, and 0.54, respectively). Performance was similar to that reported for conventional LUR models of NO2 and NO in this region (116 sites) and better than that for mean {$\sigma$}ap from fixed-location samplers (25 sites). Models of the mean, 75th, and 90th percentiles favored predictors describing truck, rather than total, traffic. This approach is applicable to other urban areas to facilitate the development of LUR models for particulate matter.},

However, monitoring air quality in a high-density area like Sunway City, Selangor, Malaysia is challenging due to the limitation of the local monitoring network. To establish a comprehensive data for air pollution in Sunway City, a mobile monitoring campaign was employed around the city area with a duration of approximately 6 months, from September 2018 to March 2019. Measurements of air pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were performed by using mobile air pollution sensors facilitated with a GPS device. In order to acquire a more in-depth understanding on traffic-related air pollution, the measurement period was divided into two different time blocks, which were morning hours (8 a.m.\textendash 12 p.m.) and afternoon hours (3 p.m.\textendash 7 p.m.). The data set was analysed by splitting Sunway City into different zones and routes to differentiate the conditions of each region. Meteorological variables such as ambient temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed were studied in line with the pollutant concentrations. The air quality in Sunway City was then compared with various air quality standards such as Malaysian Air Quality Standards and World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines to understand the risk of exposure to air pollution by the residence in Sunway City.},

In Toronto, PM2.5 levels were influenced both by local urban activities and also by regional-scale transport. Although several PMF solutions were possible, an eight-source model for explaining the observed Toronto PM2.5 was found to provide realistic results and interesting insights into sources. The four main sources were coal combustion related to regional transport and secondary sulfate (26\%), secondary nitrate related to both local and upwind sources of NOx and NH3 (36\%), secondary organic aerosols (SOA) formed from a variety of precursor organic emissions (15\%), and motor vehicle traffic (10\%). The other detectable sources were road salt (winter) and three types of primary PM2.5 hypothesized to be associated with smelters, coal and oil combustion, industry, and local construction. Overall, motor vehicle-related emissions (including road salt and nitrate) were estimated to be responsible for about 40\% of the PM2.5. In the summer, the SOA mass was estimated to contribute {$\sim$}20\% to the PM2.5. Inclusion of water-soluble, low-molecular-weight organic acids led to identification of this component, thus providing a significant improvement in PMF's ability to resolve sources. Without organic acid measurements the SOA portion of the observed PM2.5 was assigned to the secondary coal component, increasing its contribution and resulting in a source profile with an unrealistic amount of organic mass. This suggests that in the northeastern part of North America, there are physical and/or chemical processes that lead to close interaction between secondary organic and inorganic aerosols.}

Effective and efficient monitoring and mitigation of air pollution require a comprehensive understanding of the air pollution process through a reliable database carrying important information about the spatiotemporal variations of air pollutant concentrations at various spatial and temporal scales. Traditional analysis suffers from the severe insufficiency of data collected by only a few stations. In this study, we propose a rigorous framework for the integration of air pollutant concentration data coming from the ground-based stations, which are spatially sparse but temporally dense, and mobile sensors, which are spatially dense but temporally sparse. Based on the integrated database which is relatively dense in space and time, we then estimate air pollutant concentrations for given location and time by applying a two-step local regression model to the data. This study advances the frontier of basic research in air pollution monitoring via the integration of station and mobile sensors and sets up the stage for further research on other spatiotemporal problems involving multi-source and multi-scale information.},

A geostatistical technique is described to characterize the spatial scale of woodsmoke particulates collected for 19 evenings over two heating seasons in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Semivariograms were applied to 20 data sets (19 evenings and a combined data set) to characterize the appropriate spatial-analysis scale as defined by the semivariogram range, the maximum distance of spatial dependence. Typically, the semivariogram range occurred at 2673m. This method can be used to identify an optimal sampling interval for woodsmoke data collection, to define the neighbourhood size for performing spatial analyses, and to produce robust model variables and parameters by characterizing the degree of spatial autocorrelation in the data set.},

In addition, the minimum number of days required to precisely estimate on-road PM2.5 concentrations was estimated. The results showed that the on-road PM2.5 concentrations were highly correlated with PM2.5 concentrations measured at a nearby roadside air quality monitoring station (AQMS) in both winter and summer, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.89\textendash 0.93. The resulting maps of winter and summer on-road PM2.5 concentrations revealed small-scale spatial patterns used to identify more polluted areas. In addition, approximately 12 and 4 days were required to precisely capture spatial patterns of PM2.5 concentrations, with R2 higher than 0.6 in winter and in summer.

  abstract = {Generally, there are only a few fixed air quality monitoring stations installed in villages or rural areas and only a few studies on small-scale variations in air pollution have been described in detail, which make it difficult to estimate human exposure in such environments and related adverse health effects. Moreover, biomass combustion can be an important source of air pollution in rural areas, comparable to vehicle and industrial emissions in urban planning. And their air pollutants are mainly affected by local sources. For this reason, a survey on rural air pollution was carried out in this study. Therefore, portable, battery-powered monitoring devices were used to measure particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, PM1, particle number concentration, and black carbon) in order to study air quality in rural communities. The focus of the investigations was to explore the application of mobile monitoring equipment in small-scale environments, compare the differences in rural air pollutants between two neighboring villages in two countries, and the identification of pollution hotspots. The measurements were carried out in November 2018 in two villages on the German-Czech border. Over a period of four days, 21 mobile measurements along fixed routes were carried out simultaneously at both locations. The analysis of the data revealed significant differences in PN and PM concentrations in rural air pollutants between the two countries. The spatial and temporal distribution of air pollution hotspots in the Czech village was higher than that in the German village. The relationships between the measurement parameters were weak but highly significant and the meteorological parameters can effect air pollution. Overall, the results of this study show that mobile measurements are suitable for effectively recording and distinguishing spatial and temporal characteristics of air quality.},

  abstract = {Black carbon (BC) has emerged as a major contributor to global climate change. Cities play an important role in global BC emission. The present study investigated the spatial pattern of in-traffic BC at a high spatial resolution in Shanghai, the commercial and financial center in Mainland China. The determinants including road network, social economic status and point-source pollutants, which may influence the BC spatial variability were also discussed. From October to December 2016, mobile monitoring was conducted to assess the BC concentrations on three sampling routes in Shanghai with a total length of 116\,km. The results showed that the mean in-traffic BC among three sampling routes was 10.77\,{$\pm$}\,3.50\,{$\mu$}g/m3. BC concentrations showed a significant spatial heterogeneity. The highest BC concentrations were near industrial sources and that those high concentrations were associated with either direct emissions from the industries, freight traffic, or both. With the widely distributed polluting enterprises and high emitting vehicles, the average BC in the low urbanization areas (12.80\,{$\pm$}\,4.54\,{$\mu$}g/m3) was 57\% higher than that in the urban core (7.77\,{$\pm$}\,2.24\,{$\mu$}g/m3). Furthermore, a land use regression (LUR) model based on mobile monitoring was developed to examine the determinants and its spatial variability of BC measurements which corresponded to 17 predictor variables, e.g. road network, land use, meteorological condition etc., in 7 buffer distances (100\,m to 10\,km). The variables of meteorological, socio-economical and the distance to BC point-sources were selected as the independent variables. It was found that the established LUR model could explain a proportion (68\%) of the variability of BC. LUR modeling from mobile measurements was possible, but more work related to the effect of traffic regulation on BC could be helpful for informing best model practice.},

The results showed that the annual average PM2.5 concentration was 164.61\,{$\pm$}\,79.14\,{$\mu$}g/m3 with the highest level in winter and the lowest in summer. The concentrations of the carbonaceous aerosol, water-soluble inorganic ions, water-soluble organic acids, crustal elements and trace elements were 36.98\,{$\pm$}\,22.49\,{$\mu$}g/m3, 78.05\,{$\pm$}\,42.68\,{$\mu$}g/m3, 0.45\,{$\pm$}\,0.28\,{$\mu$}g/m3, 9.20\,{$\pm$}\,6.11\,{$\mu$}g/m3 and 1.76\,{$\pm$}\,1.24\,{$\mu$}g/m3, respectively. S was the most abundant element in the area, which was combined with high concentration Cl-, suggesting the influence of coal combustion. There were a high OC/EC ratio (6.68), a pronounced fractions of Ca2+ (1.87\%) and a Ni/V ratio of 2.48 in PM2.5, indicating the impact of petrochemical industry and its downstream enterprises. EFs showed that Al, Na, Mg, Ca, Ti and Fe originated from crust sources, while Cl, S, K, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Br, Sr, Cd, Ba and Pb were related to the human activities. Six source factors were identified by positive matrix factorization (PMF) model with an order of soil dust (29.2\%)\,{$>$}\,secondary formation (25.7\%)\,{$>$}\,coal combustion (16.1\%)\,{$>$}\,petrochemical industry (14.9\%)\,{$>$}\,biomass burning (11.3\%)\,{$>$}\,vehicular emission (2.8\%).

  abstract = {Air quality data collected in the California Regional PM10/PM2.5 Air Quality Study (CRPAQS) are analyzed to qualitatively assess the processes affecting secondary aerosol formation in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV). This region experiences some of the highest fine particulate matter (PM2.5) mass concentrations in California ({$\leq$}188 {$\mu$}g/m3 24-hr average), and secondary aerosol components (as a group) frequently constitute over half of the fine aerosol mass in winter. The analyses are based on 15 days of high-frequency filter and canister measurements and several months of wintertime continuous gas and aerosol measurements. The phase-partitioning of nitrogen oxide (NOx)-related nitrogen species and carbonaceous species shows that concentrations of gaseous precursor species are far more abundant than measured secondary aerosol nitrate or estimated secondary organic aerosols. Comparisons of ammonia and nitric acid concentrations indicate that ammonium nitrate formation is limited by the availability of nitric acid rather than ammonia. Time-resolved aerosol nitrate data collected at the surface and on a 90-m tower suggest that both the daytime and nighttime nitric acid formation pathways are active, and entrainment of aerosol nitrate formed aloft at night may explain the spatial homogeneity of nitrate in the SJV. NOx and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions plus background O3 levels are expected to determine NOx oxidation and nitric acid production rates, which currently control the ammonium nitrate levels in the SJV. Secondary organic aerosol formation is significant in winter, especially in the Fresno urban area. Formation of secondary organic aerosol is more likely limited by the rate of VOC oxidation than the availability of VOC precursors in winter.},

  abstract = {Data analysis and modeling were performed to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of wintertime transport and dispersion processes and the impact of these processes on particulate matter (PM) concentrations in the California San Joaquin Valley (SJV). Radar wind profiler (RWP) and radio acoustic sounding system (RASS) data collected from 18 sites throughout Central California were used to estimate hourly mixing heights for a 3-month period and to create case studies of high-resolution diagnostic wind fields, which were used for trajectory and dispersion analyses. Data analyses show that PM episodes were characterized by an upper-level ridge of high pressure that generally produced light winds through the entire depth of the atmospheric boundary layer and low mixing heights compared with nonepisode days. Peak daytime mixing heights during episodes were ϳ400 m above ground level (agl) compared with ϳ800 m agl during nonepisodes. These episode/nonepisode differences were observed throughout the SJV. Dispersion modeling indicates that the range of influence of primary PM emitted in major population centers within the SJV ranged from ϳ15 to 50 km. Trajectory analyses revealed that little intrabasin pollutant transport occurred among major population centers in the SJV; however, interbasin transport from the northern SJV and Sacramento regions into the San Francisco Bay Area (SFBA) was often observed. In addition, this analysis demonstrates the usefulness of integrating RWP/RASS measurements into data analyses and modeling to improve the understanding of meteorological processes that impact pollution, such as aloft transport and boundary layer evolution.},

Emission intensities varied widely for natural gas production, where older, low-producing developments such as Medicine Hat, Alberta showed high emission intensities, and newer developments in Montney, British Columbia showed emission intensities that are amongst the lowest in North America.

Two of the main components of TRAP are black carbon (BC) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which have both been causally associated with increased mortality. To assess the impact of cyclists' exposure to TRAP, a battery-powered mobile monitoring station was designed to sample air pollutants along five bike routes in Boston, Massachusetts. The bike routes were categorized into three types: bike paths, which are separated from vehicle traffic; bike lanes, which are adjacent to traffic; and designated bike lanes, which are shared traffic lanes for buses and cyclists. Bike lanes were found to have significantly higher concentrations of BC and NO2 than bike paths in both adjusted and unadjusted generalized linear models. Higher concentrations were observed in designated bike lanes than bike paths; however, this association was only significant for NO2. After adjusting for traffic density, background concentration, and proximity to intersections, bike lanes were found to have concentrations of BC and NO2 that were approximately 33\% higher than bike paths. Distance from the road, vegetation barriers, and reduced intersection density appear to influence these variations. These findings suggest that cyclists can reduce their exposure to TRAP during their commute by using bike paths preferentially over bike lanes regardless of the potential increase of traffic near these routes.},

  abstract = {We propose three modeling methods using a mobile sensor network to generate high spatio-temporal resolution air pollution maps for urban environments. In our deployment in Lausanne (Switzerland), dedicated sensing nodes are anchored to the public buses and measure multiple air quality parameters including the Lung Deposited Surface Area (LDSA), a state of the art metric for quantifying human exposure to ultra fine particles. In this paper, our focus is on generating LDSA maps. In particular, since the sensor network coverage is spatially and temporally dynamic, we leverage models to estimate the values for the locations and times where the data are not available. We first discretize the area topologically based on the street segments in the city and we then propose the following three prediction models: i) a log-linear regression model based on nine meteorological (e.g., Temperature and precipitations) and gaseous (e.g., NO 2 and CO) explanatory variables measured at two static stations in the city, ii) a novel network-based log-linear regression model that takes into account the LDSA values of the most correlated streets and also the nine explanatory variables mentioned above, iii) a novel Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) in which each street segment is considered as one node of the graph, and inference on conditional joint probability distributions of the nodes results in estimating the values in the nodes of interest. More than 44 millions of geo- and time-stamped LDSA measurements (i.e., More than 14 months of real data) are used in this paper to evaluate the proposed modeling approaches in various time resolutions (hourly, daily, weekly and monthly). The results show that the three approaches bring significant improvements in R2, RMSE and FAC metrics compared to a baseline K-Nearest Neighbor method.},

In this study, we quantified the gradient in black carbon (BC) and air toxics concentrations from the I-70 freeway in the Elyria-Swansea environmental justice neighborhood in Denver, Colorado, during three measurement campaigns in 2017\textendash 2018. The average hourly upwind-downwind gradient of BC concentrations from the roadway was 500\textendash 800 ng/m3, equal to an increment of approximately 30-80\% above local background levels within 180 m of the freeway. When integrated over all wind directions, the gradients were smaller, approximately 150\textendash 300 ng/m3 ( 11-18\%) over the course of nearly four months of measurements. No statistically significant gradient in air toxics (e.g., benzene, formaldehyde, etc.) was found, likely because the uncertainties in the mean concentrations were larger than the magnitude of the gradient ({$<$}25\%). This finding is in contrast to some earlier studies in which small gradients of benzene and other VOCs were found. We estimate that sample sizes of at least 100 individual measurements would have been required to estimate mean concentrations with sufficient certainty to quantify gradients on the order of {$\pm$}10\% uncertainty. These gradient estimates are smaller than those found in previous studies over the past two decades; more stringent emissions standards, the local fleet age distribution, and/or the steady turnover of the vehicle fleet may be reducing the overall impact of roadway emissions on near-road communities. Implications: Gradients of near-road pollution may be declining in the near-road environment as tailpipe emissions from the vehicle fleet continue to decrease. Near-road concentration gradients of mobile source air toxics, including benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and ethylbenzene, will require higher sample sizes to quantify as emissions continue to decline.},

Model runs incorporating sets of experimentally determined kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) for the reactions of CH4 with each of the oxidants OH, O(1D), and Cl are examined with the goals of determining (1) how well the 2-D model can reproduce the observations for both the carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions, (2) what factors are responsible for the observed increase in the apparent isotopic fractionation factors with decreasing methane mixing ratios, and (3) how sensitive the modeled isotopic compositions are to various experimentally determined KIEs. Bound by estimates of the effects of uncertainties in model chemistry and transport on isotopic compositions, we then examine the constraints the ER-2 observations place on values for the KIEs. For the carbon KIE for reaction of CH4 with O(1D), for example, the analysis of model results and observations favors the larger of the experimental values, 1.013, over a value of 1.001. These analyses also suggest that intercomparisons of results from different models using a given set of KIEs may be useful as a new diagnostic of model-model differences in integrated chemistry and transport.},

We then used national distributions of risk-weighted concentrations to identify the air toxics of most concern.ResultsConcentrations of benzene, carbon tetrachloride, arsenic, 1,3-butadiene, and acetaldehyde were above the 10-6 cancer risk level at most sites nationally with a high degree of confidence. Concentrations of tetrachloroethylene, ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene were also often greater than the 10-6 cancer risk level, but we have less confidence in the estimated risk associated with these pollutants. Formaldehyde and chromium VI concentrations were either above or below the 10-6 cancer risk level, depending on the choice of agency-recommended 10-6 level. The method detection limits of eight additional pollutants were too high to rule out that concentrations were above the 10-6 cancer risk level. Concentrations of 52 compounds compared with chronic noncancer benchmarks indicated that only acrolein concentrations were greater than the noncancer reference concentration at most monitoring sites.ConclusionsMost pollutants with national site-level averages greater than health benchmarks were also pollutants of concern identified in modeled national-scale risk assessments. Current monitoring networks need more sensitive ambient measurement techniques to better characterize the air toxics problem in the United States.},

VOCs were sampled in the downtown area (Central site) and an industrial area on the eastern side of the city (East site). Concentrations of most VOCs were highest at the East site, with an average total VOC mass concentration of 221~{$\mu$}g~m-3. The average total VOC mass concentration at the Central site was 65~{$\mu$}g~m-3. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's positive matrix factorization receptor model (EPA PMF) was used to apportion ambient concentrations of VOCs into eleven factors, which were associated with emissions sources. On average, 94 and 99\% of the measured mass were apportioned by PMF at the East and Central site, respectively. Factors include transportation combustion (gasoline and diesel), industrial sources (industrial evaporative, industrial feedstock, gasoline production/storage, industrial chemical use), mixed mobile and industrial (gasoline evaporative, fugitive butane), a biogenic source, a natural gas related source, and a factor that was associated with global background pollutants transported into the area. Transportation sources accounted for more than half of the reconstructed VOC mass concentration at the Central site, but less than 10\% of the reconstructed mass concentration at the East site. By contrast, industrial sources accounted for ten times more of the reconstructed VOC mass concentration at the East site than at the Central site and were responsible for approximately 75\% of the reconstructed VOC mass concentration observed at the East site. Of the six industrial factors identified at the East site, four were linked to petrochemical industry production and storage. The two largest contributors to the reconstructed VOC mass concentration at the East site were associated with fugitive emissions of volatile species (butanes, pentanes, hexane, and cyclohexane); together, these two factors accounted for more than 50\% of the reconstructed VOC mass concentration at the East site in contrast to less than 2\% of the reconstructed mass concentration at the Central site. Natural gas related emissions accounted for 10\%\textendash 20\% of the reconstructed mass concentration at both sites. Biogenic emissions and VOCs associated with well-mixed global background were less than 10\% of the reconstructed VOC mass concentration at the Central site and less than 3\% of the reconstructed mass concentration at the East site.},

Sufficient data were available to analyze diurnal variability for 14 air toxics, seasonal variability for 24 air toxics, and annual trends for 26 air toxics. Four diurnal variation patterns were identified and labeled invariant, nighttime peak, morning peak, and daytime peak. Three distinct seasonal patterns were identified and labeled invariant, cool, and warm. Multiple air toxics showed consistent decreasing trends over three trend periods, 1990\textendash 2005, 1995\textendash 2005, and 2000\textendash 2005. Trends appeared to be relatively consistent within chemically similar pollutant groups. Hydrocarbons such as benzene, 1,3-butadiene, styrene, xylene, and toluene decreased by approximately 5\% or more per year at more than half of all monitoring sites. Concentrations of carbonyl compounds such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and propionaldehyde were equally likely to have increased or decreased at monitoring sites. Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as tetrachloroethylene, dichloromethane, and methyl chloroform decreased at more than half of all monitoring sites, but decreases among these species were much more variable than among the hydrocarbons. Lead particles decreased in concentration at most monitoring sites, but trends in other metals were not consistent over time.},

The current study assessed the capability of low-cost mobile monitors to acquire useful data in a city without a monitoring network in place (Lubbock, Texas) using a bicycle platform. The monitoring campaign resulted in 30 days of data along a 13.4 km fixed concentric route. Due to high sensitivities to airflow, the apparent wind velocity was accounted for throughout the route. The data were also normalized into percentiles in order to visualize spatial patterns.The highest estimated pollution levels were located near frequently busy intersections and roads; however, sensor issues resulted in lower confidence. Additional research is needed concerning the appropriate use of low-cost metal oxide sensors for citizen science applications, as measurements can be misleading if the user is unaware of sensors specifications. The simultaneous use of several low-cost mobile platforms, rather than a single platform, as well as the use of high-end cases, are recommended to create a more robust spatial analysis. The issues addressed from this research are important to understand for accurate and beneficial application of low-cost gaseous monitors for citizen science.},

We equipped two Google Street View cars with 1-Hz instruments to collect nitric oxide (NO) and black carbon (BC) measurements in Oakland, CA. We explore two strategies for efficiently mapping spatial air quality patterns through Monte Carlo analyses. First, we explore a ``data-only'' approach where we attempt to minimize the number of repeated visits needed to reliably estimate concentrations for all roads. Second, we combine our data with a land use regression-kriging (LUR-K) model to predict at unobserved locations; here, measurements from only a subset of roads or repeat visits are considered. Although LUR-K models did not capture the full variability of on-road concentrations, models trained with minimal data consistently captured important covariates and general spatial air pollution trends, with cross-validation R2 for log-transformed NO and BC of 0.65 and 0.43. Data-only mapping performed poorly with few (1\textendash 2) repeated drives but obtained better cross-validation R2 than the LUR-K approach within 4 to 8 repeated drive days per road segment.},

Land-use regression (LUR) techniques have been widely used for the development of exposure surfaces, however these surfaces are often highly sensitive to the data collected. With the rise of inexpensive air pollution sensors paired with GPS devices, we witness the emergence of mobile data collection protocols. For the same urban area, can we achieve a `universal' model irrespective of the number of locations and sampling visits? Can we trade the temporal representation of fixed-point sampling for a larger spatial extent afforded by mobile monitoring? This study highlights the challenges of short-term mobile sampling campaigns in terms of the resulting exposure surfaces. A mobile monitoring campaign was conducted in 2015 in Montreal; nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels at 1395 road segments were measured under repeated visits. We developed LUR models based on sub-segments, categorized in terms of the number of visits per road segment. We observe that LUR models were highly sensitive to the number of road segments and to the number of visits per road segment. The associated exposure surfaces were also highly dissimilar.},

In this study, we measured ultrafine particles (UFP) and black carbon (BC) concentrations in Toronto during summer 2016, using two short-term data collection approaches: mobile, involving 3023 road segments sampled on bicycles, and stationary, involving 92 sidewalk locations. We developed four LUR models and exposure surfaces, for the two pollutants and measurement protocols. Coefficients of determination (R2) varied from 0.434 to 0.525. Various small-scale traffic variables were included in the mobile LUR. Pearson correlation coefficients between the mobile and stationary surfaces were 0.23 for UFP and 0.49 for BC. We also compared the two surfaces using personal exposures from a panel study in Toronto conducted during the same period. The personal exposures differed from the outdoor exposures derived from the combination of GPS information and exposure surfaces. For UFP, the median for personal outdoor exposure was 26\,344 part/cm3, while the cycling and stationary surfaces predicted medians of 31\,201 and 19\,057 part/cm3. Similar trends were observed for BC, with median exposures of 1764 (personal), 1799 (cycling), and 1469 ng/m3 (stationary).},

  abstract = {The Netherlands is considered one of the hotspot areas in Europe with high concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and may not be able to meet~all standards for PM2.5 in time with current legislation (Matthijsen et~al., 2009). To improve our understanding of the composition, distribution and origin of PM2.5 in the ambient air an intensive one-year measurement campaign (from August 2007 to September 2008) was performed at five locations in the Netherlands. The five sites consist of three rural background sites, one urban background site and one curbside site. We have applied source apportionment using Positive Matrix Factorization (EPA-PMF) on the pooled data from the five sites to identify and quantify the most relevant source contributions and their spatial variability to PM2.5 in the Netherlands. The results of this study are compared to a full mass closure analysis of the data. Using EPA-PMF we could identify seven unique sources for the PM2.5 fraction: nitrate-rich secondary aerosol, sulphate-rich secondary aerosol, traffic and resuspended road dust, industrial (metal) activities/incineration, sea spray, crustal material and residual oil combustion. Wind directional analysis was used to determine the possible locations of the identified sources. On the five locations secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) is responsible for the largest contribution. The contribution of SIA to the total PM2.5 mass is largely constant at all used sites. This indicates these sources are common sources which behave like area sources and affects each site. The largest contribution of the traffic and resuspended road dust profile was found at the curbside site. Using combined data from five measurement sites provides focus on the common sources (e.g. SIA) affecting all locations.},

Using modeled national average exhaust emissions, and associated near-road contribution to PM2.5, the upper bound of2.0~{$\pm~$}0.2~\textmu g/m3 isprojected to decrease 30\% from 2017 to2040, for the types of highways assessed here, assuming a roadway with 8\% heavy-duty vehicles and constant traffic volumes. These results can help inform transportation conformity POAQC designations.},

  abstract = {Low-cost sensors can provide insight on the spatio-temporal variability of air pollution, provided that sufficient efforts are made to ensure data quality. Here, 19 AirBeam particulate matter (PM) sensors were deployed from December 2016 to January 2017 to determine the spatial variability of PM2.5 in Sacramento, California. Prior to, and after, the study, the 19 sensors were deployed and collocated at a regulatory air monitoring site. The sensors demonstrated a high degree of precision during all collocated measurement periods (Pearson R2 = 0.98 \&minus; 0.99 across all sensors), with little drift. A sensor-specific correction factor was developed such that each sensor reported a comparable value. Sensors had a moderate degree of correlation with regulatory monitors during the study (R2 = 0.60 \&minus; 0.68 at two sites). In a multi-linear regression model, the deviation between sensor and reference measurements of PM2.5 had the highest correlation with dew point and relative humidity. Sensor measurements were used to estimate the PM2.5 spatial variability, finding an average pairwise coefficient of divergence of 0.22 and a range of 0.14 to 0.33, indicating mostly homogeneous distributions. No significant difference in the average sensor PM concentrations between environmental justice (EJ) and non-EJ communities (p value = 0.24) was observed.},

Twenty-five years of research has linked short-term PM2.5, that is, increases of at least 10 {$\mu$}g/m3 that can occur in-between regulatory readings, to increased mortality. Even as new technologies have emerged that could readily monitor short-term PM2.5, such as real-time monitoring and mobile monitoring, their primary application has been for research, not for air quality management. The Gulf oil spill offers a strategic setting in which regulatory monitoring, computer modeling, and stationary monitoring could be directly compared to mobile monitoring. Mobile monitoring was found to best capture the variability of PM2.5 during the disaster. The research also found that each short-term increase ({$\geq$}10 {$\mu$}g/m3) in fine particulate matter was associated with a statistically significant increase of 0.105 deaths (p \&lt; 0.001) in people aged 65 and over, which represents a 0.32\% increase. This research contributes to understanding the effects of PM2.5 on mortality during a disaster and provides justification for environmental managers to monitor PM2.5 variability, not only hourly averages of PM2.5 concentration.},

Air enters the stratosphere predominantly in the tropics, where the very low temperatures around the tropopause constrain water vapour mixing ratios to a few parts per million. Observations of stratospheric water vapour show a large positive long-term trend, which can not be explained by change in tropopause temperatures. Trends in the partitioning between vapour and ice of water entering the stratosphere have been suggested to resolve this conundrum. We present measurements of stratospheric H2O, HDO, CH4 and CH3D in the period 1991\textendash 2007 to evaluate this hypothesis. Because of fractionation processes during phase changes, the hydrogen isotopic composition of H2O is a sensitive indicator of changes in the partitioning of vapour and ice. We find that the seasonal variations of H2O are mirrored in the variation of the ratio of HDO to H2O with a slope of the correlation consistent with water entering the stratosphere mainly as vapour. The variability in the fractionation over the entire observation period is well explained by variations in H2O. The isotopic data allow concluding that the trend in ice arising from particulate water is no more than (0.01 {$\pm$} 0.13) ppmv/decade in the observation period. Our observations suggest that between 1991 and 2007 the contribution from changes in particulate water transported through the tropopause plays only a minor role in altering in the amount of water entering the stratosphere.},

Indeed, a large number of environmental epidemiological studies have quantified the health impacts of population exposure to pollution. In previous studies, exposure estimates at the population level have not considered spatially- and temporally varying populations present in study regions. Therefore, in the first study of it is kind, we use measured population activity patterns representing several million people to evaluate population-weighted exposure to air pollution on a city-wide scale. Mobile and wireless devices yield information about where and when people are present, thus collective activity patterns were determined using counts of connections to the cellular network. Population-weighted exposure to PM2.5 in New York City (NYC), herein termed ``Active Population Exposure'' was evaluated using population activity patterns and spatiotemporal PM2.5 concentration levels, and compared to ``Home Population Exposure'', which assumed a static population distribution as per Census data. Areas of relatively higher population-weighted exposures were concentrated in different districts within NYC in both scenarios. These were more centralized for the ``Active Population Exposure'' scenario. Population-weighted exposure computed in each district of NYC for the ``Active'' scenario were found to be statistically significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) different to the ``Home'' scenario for most districts. In investigating the temporal variability of the ``Active'' population-weighted exposures determined in districts, these were found to be significantly different (p {$<$} 0.05) during the daytime and the nighttime. Evaluating population exposure to air pollution using spatiotemporal population mobility patterns warrants consideration in future environmental epidemiological studies linking air quality and human health.},

The objective of this study was to measure air pollutant levels in a near-highway urban area over a wide range of traffic and meteorological conditions using a mobile monitoring platform. The study was performed in a 2.3-km2 area in Somerville, Massachusetts (USA), near Interstate 93 (I-93), a highway that carries 150,000 vehicles per day. The mobile platform was equipped with rapid-response instruments and was driven repeatedly along a 15.4-km route on 55 days between September 2009 and August 2010. Monitoring was performed in 4\textendash 6-h shifts in the morning, afternoon, and evening on both weekdays and weekends in winter, spring, summer, and fall. Measurements were made of particle number concentration (PNC; 4\textendash 3000~nm), particle size distribution, fine particle mass (PM2.5), particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pPAH), black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NO and NOx). The highest pollutant concentrations were measured within 0\textendash 50~m of I-93 with distance-decay gradients varying depending on traffic and meteorology. The most pronounced variations were observed for PNC. Annual median PNC 0\textendash 50~m from I-93 was two-fold higher compared to the background area ({$>$}1~km from I-93). In general, PNC levels were highest in winter and lowest in summer and fall, higher on weekdays and Saturdays compared to Sundays, and higher during morning rush hour compared to later in the day. Similar spatial and temporal trends were observed for NO, CO and BC, but not for PM2.5. Spatial variations in PNC distance-decay gradients were non-uniform largely due to contributions from local street traffic. Hour-to-hour, day-to-day and season-to-season variations in PNC were of the same magnitude as spatial variations. Datasets containing fine-scale temporal and spatial variation of air pollution levels near highways may help to inform exposure assessment efforts.},

Fixed-site monitors have been shown to be largely inadequate for representing concentrations at nearby locations, resulting in the increasing use of spatial modelling or mobile sampling methods to achieve spatial saturation. In this study, we employ the use of a simple bicycle to sample concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFPs), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM10) at two small areas ({$<$}2.5~km2) in South Auckland, New Zealand. Portable instruments were mounted inside a custom-built casing at the front of the bicycle and every street within each study area was sampled in a grid-like fashion, at four times of day (07:00, 12:00, 17:00 and 22:00). Each area has a six-lane highway running through its centre and the core aim was to visualise and describe spatial variability of pollutant levels about the highway, main arterials and quieter streets, at periods of contrasting meteorological and traffic conditions. A total of 20 sampling runs in each area (five at each of the four timings) were conducted. Meteorological data were logged continuously at background sites within each study area. Results show that the influence of highway traffic (UFPs, CO) was strongest during the mornings and late evenings when wind speeds were low, while for the midday and afternoon timings, concentrations were highest at the arterial and shopping zones. Concentrations of PM10 appeared to be strongest in the residential areas during mornings and late evenings, suggesting an influence of wood burning for home heating. For all timings combined, for all three pollutants, it appears the arterial roads featuring shops and numerous intersections with traffic lights, had a stronger influence on concentrations than the busier but more free-flowing highways. This study provides not only an insight into microspatial hotspot variation across suburbs, but also how this variation shifts diurnally.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The province of Alberta, Canada, is home to three oil sands regions which, combined, contain the third largest deposit of oil in the world. Of these, the Athabasca oil sands region is the largest. As part of Environment and Climate Change Canada's program in support of the Joint Canada-Alberta Implementation Plan for Oil Sands Monitoring program, concentrations of trace elements in PM2.\,5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5\,\textmu m in diameter) were measured through two campaigns that involved different methodologies: a long-term filter campaign and a short-term intensive campaign. In the long-term campaign, 24\,h filter samples were collected once every 6~days over a 2-year period (December~2010\textendash November~2012) at three air monitoring stations in the regional municipality of Wood Buffalo. For the intensive campaign (August~2013), hourly measurements were made with an online instrument at one air monitoring station; daily filter samples were also collected. The hourly and 24\,h filter data were analyzed individually using positive matrix factorization. Seven emission sources of PM2.\,5 trace elements were thereby identified: two types of upgrader emissions, soil, haul road dust, biomass burning, and two sources of mixed origin. The upgrader emissions, soil, and haul road dust sources were identified through both the methodologies and both methodologies identified a mixed source, but these exhibited more differences than similarities. The second upgrader emissions and biomass burning sources were only resolved by the hourly and filter methodologies, respectively. The similarity of the receptor modeling results from the two methodologies provided reassurance as to the identity of the sources. Overall, much of the PM2.\,5-related trace elements were found to be anthropogenic, or at least to be aerosolized through anthropogenic activities. These emissions may in part explain the previously reported higher levels of trace elements in snow, water, and biota samples collected near the oil sands operations.},

  abstract = {Despite their significant role in source apportionment analysis, studies dedicated to the identification of tracer elements of emission sources of atmospheric particulate matter based on air quality data are relatively scarce. The studies describing tracer elements of specific sources currently available in the literature mostly focus on emissions from traffic or large-scale combustion processes (e.g. power plants), but not on specific industrial processes. Furthermore, marker elements are not usually determined at receptor sites, but during emission. In our study, trace element concentrations in PM10 and PM2.5 were determined at 33 monitoring stations in Spain throughout the period 1995\textendash 2006. Industrial emissions from different forms of metallurgy (steel, stainless steel, copper, zinc), ceramic and petrochemical industries were evaluated. Results obtained at sites with no significant industrial development allowed us to define usual concentration ranges for a number of trace elements in rural and urban background environments. At industrial and traffic hotspots, average trace metal concentrations were highest, exceeding rural background levels by even one order of magnitude in the cases of Cr, Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Sn, W, V, Ni, Cs and Pb. Steel production emissions were linked to high levels of Cr, Mn, Ni, Zn, Mo, Cd, Se and Sn (and probably Pb). Copper metallurgy areas showed high levels of As, Bi, Ga and Cu. Zinc metallurgy was characterised by high levels of Zn and Cd. Glazed ceramic production areas were linked to high levels of Zn, As, Se, Zr, Cs, Tl, Li, Co and Pb. High levels of Ni and V (in association) were tracers of petrochemical plants and/or fuel-oil combustion. At one site under the influence of heavy vessel traffic these elements could be considered tracers (although not exclusively) of shipping emissions. Levels of Zn\textendash Ba and Cu\textendash Sb were relatively high in urban areas when compared with industrialised regions due to tyre and brake abrasion, respectively.},

In the troposphere, the D/H ratio of H2 is enriched by 120\textperthousand{} relative to the world's oceans2,3,4. This cannot be explained by the sources of H2 for which the D/H ratio has been measured to date (for example, fossil fuels and biomass burning)5,6. But the isotopic composition of H2 from its single largest source\textemdash the photochemical oxidation of methane\textemdash has yet to be determined. Here we show that the D/H ratio of stratospheric H2 develops enrichments greater than 440\textperthousand, the most extreme D/H enrichment observed in a terrestrial material. We estimate the D/H ratio of H2 produced from CH4 in the stratosphere, where production is isolated from the influences of non-photochemical sources and sinks, showing that the chain of reactions producing H2 from CH4 concentrates D in the product H2. This enrichment, which we estimate is similar on a global average in the troposphere, contributes substantially to the D/H ratio of tropospheric H2.},

In its 2006 rulemaking, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency identified sample projects that would likely be POAQCs, including a new highway project with annual average daily traffic (AADT) greater than 125,000 and at least 8\% diesel truck traffic. The objective of this study was to identify project characteristics that could reasonably exclude the project from consideration as a POAQC. Scenario analyses were performed for a hypothetical project that featured a new freeway with four mixed-flow lanes and baseline traffic activity of 125,000 AADT and 8\% diesel truck traffic. The MO Vehicle Emission Simulator and the Emission FACtors models were used to quantify PM10 and PM2.5 emissions for a 2006 analysis and to evaluate the impact of fleet turnover and truck percentages on project-level emissions from 2006 to 2035. Fleet turnover effects sharply reduce project-level PM2.5 emissions over time. For an analysis year of 2015, impacts from a highway project with 125,000 AADT and 8\% trucks are approximately 50\% less than impacts from such a project in 2006. In contrast, fleet turnover effects do not substantially reduce PM10 emissions, since re-entrained road dust emissions and tire wear and brake wear emissions increasingly dominate project-level inventories over time, and these emissions vary little by analysis year.},

Samples cover latitudes from 1\textdegree S to 89\textdegree N and altitudes from 11 to 21 km, providing CH4 mixing ratios that range from 1744 to 716 ppbv. Measurements of isotope ratios were made by continuous-flow gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry which provides high-precision analyses on 60 ml aliquots of air. These measurements comprise the first upper atmosphere isotopic CH4 data set to date using this technique and the most extensive with respect to latitude and season in any case. Values of {$\delta$}13C-CH4 on the V-PDB scale range from -47.28\textperthousand{} near the tropical tropopause to -34.05\textperthousand{} in the high northern latitude stratosphere. Values of {$\delta$}D on the V-SMOW scale range from -90.9\textperthousand{} to +26.4\textperthousand. Correlations of isotope ratios with CH4 mixing ratios show enrichment in the heavy isotopes as CH4 mixing ratios decrease due to kinetic isotope effects associated with oxidation by reaction with OH, Cl, and O(1D). Empirical fractionation factors are found to be highly dependent on the range of CH4 mixing ratio considered, increasing with decreasing mixing ratio. Systematic nonlinearity in a Rayleigh fractionation model suggests a range of stratospheric fractionation factors, {$\alpha$}Cstrat = 1.0108 {$\pm$} 0.0004 to 1.0204 {$\pm$} 0.0004 (2{$\sigma$}) and {$\alpha$}Hstrat = 1.115 {$\pm$} 0.008 to 1.198 {$\pm$} 0.008 (2{$\sigma$}), from high to low CH4 mixing ratio, respectively. The variation in {$\alpha$} over the range in mixing ratios reflect changes in partitioning between CH4 sink reactions in different regions of the stratosphere. In Part 1, these new high-precision observations are discussed and compared with other stratospheric and tropospheric isotope measurements. In Part 2 [McCarthy et al., 2003] the observations are compared with 2-D model results, and implications for the kinetic isotope effects for reactions with OH, Cl, and O(1D) are discussed.},

  abstract = {Mobile monitoring has provided a means for broad spatial measurements of air pollutants that are otherwise impractical to measure with multiple fixed site sampling strategies. However, the larger the mobile monitoring route the less temporally dense measurements become, which may limit the usefulness of short-term mobile monitoring for applications that require long-term averages. To investigate the stationarity of short-term mobile monitoring measurements, we calculated long term medians derived from a mobile monitoring campaign that also employed 2-week integrated passive sampler detectors (PSD) for NOx, Ozone, and nine volatile organic compounds at 43 intersections distributed across the entire city of Baltimore, MD. This is one of the largest mobile monitoring campaigns in terms of spatial extent undertaken at this time. The mobile platform made repeat measurements every third day at each intersection for 6\textendash 10~min at a resolution of 10~s. In two-week periods in both summer and winter seasons, each site was visited 3\textendash 4 times, and a temporal adjustment was applied to each dataset. We present the correlations between eight species measured using mobile monitoring and the 2-week PSD data and observe correlations between mobile NOx measurements and PSD NOx measurements in both summer and winter (Pearson's r~=~0.84 and 0.48, respectively). The summer season exhibited the strongest correlations between multiple pollutants, whereas the winter had comparatively few statistically significant correlations. In the summer CO was correlated with PSD pentanes (r~=~0.81), and PSD NOx was correlated with mobile measurements of black carbon (r~=~0.83), two ultrafine particle count measures (r~=~0.8), and intermodal (1\textendash 3~{$\mu$}m) particle counts (r~=~0.73). Principal Component Analysis of the combined PSD and mobile monitoring data revealed multipollutant features consistent with light duty vehicle traffic, diesel exhaust and crankcase blow by. These features were more consistent with published source profiles of traffic-related air pollutants than features based on the PSD data alone. Short-term mobile monitoring shows promise for capturing long-term spatial patterns of traffic-related air pollution, and is complementary to PSD sampling strategies.},

PM data were from 1week of morning and afternoon mobile and stationary air pollution measurements in each of the study neighborhoods. PM2.5 and PM10 were measured continuously, with matched GPS coordinates. Data on biomass fuel use were from the Ghana 2000 population and housing census and from a census of wood and charcoal stoves along the mobile monitoring paths. We analyzed the associations of PM with sources using a mixed-effects regression model accounting for temporal and spatial autocorrelation. After adjusting for other factors, the density of wood stoves, fish smoking, and trash burning along the mobile monitoring path as well as road capacity and surface were associated with higher PM2.5. Road capacity and road surface variables were also associated with PM10, but the association with biomass sources was weak or absent. While wood stoves and fish smoking were significant sources of air pollution, addressing them would require financial and physical access to alternative fuels for low-income households and communities.},

In this study, we used a mobile monitoring approach to study the spatial-temporal variability of air and noise pollution in urban neighborhoods of Philadelphia. During summer 2017, we used portable instruments to measure PM2.5, black carbon (BC), and noise levels along 5\,km paths in four residential neighborhoods (Tioga, Mill Creek, Chestnut Hill, and Northern Liberties) and one commercial district (Center City) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. A total of 62 sets of measurements were made at three different times of day (during morning rush hour, mid-afternoon, and during afternoon rush hour) from June 5 to July 7, 2017. Spatially, there was a significant difference in PM2.5 concentrations among the four residential neighborhoods. Overall, the Chestnut Hill neighborhood had the highest PM2.5 concentrations (13.25\,{$\pm$}\,6.89\,{$\mu$}g/m3), followed by Tioga (9.58\,{$\pm$}\,4.83\,{$\mu$}g/m3), Northern Liberties (7.02\,{$\pm$}\,4.17\,{$\mu$}g/m3), and Mill Creek (3.9\,{$\pm$}\,4.5\,{$\mu$}g/m3). There was temporal variability of pollutants depending on the neighborhood; Northern Liberties demonstrated the highest temporal variability in these data. The highest PM2.5 (18.86\,{$\pm$}\,3.17\,mg/m3) was measured in the Chestnut Hill neighborhood during mid-afternoon. Mean PM2.5, BC, and noise levels based on mobile measurements at Philadelphia during summer 2017 were 8.41\,{$\pm$}\,4.31\,{$\mu$}g/m3, 0.99\,{$\pm$}\,0.44\,{$\mu$}g\,C/m3, and 62.01\,{$\pm$}\,3.20\,dBA, respectively. Environmental noise showed the highest temporal variation of the monitored components for 3 time periods.

This study aims to identify critical building morphological design factors and provide a scientific basis for urban planning optimization. Through a long-term mobile monitoring campaign, a four-month (spanning across summer and winter seasons) spatiotemporal street-level PM2.5 dataset was acquired. On top of that, the small-scale spatial variability of PM2.5 in the high-density downtown area of Hong Kong was mapped. Seventeen building morphological factors were also calculated for the monitoring area using geographical information system (GIS). Multivariate statistical analysis was then conducted to correlate the PM2.5 data and morphological data. The results indicate that the building morphology of the high-density environment of Hong Kong explains up to 37\% of the spatial variability in the mobile monitored PM2.5. The building morphological factors with the highest correlation to PM2.5 concentration are building volume density, building coverage ratio, podium layer frontal area index and building height variability. The quantitative correlation between PM2.5 and morphological factors can be adopted to develop scientifically robust and straightforward optimization strategies for planners. This will allow considerations of pollution dispersion to be incorporated in planning practices at an early stage.},

Though air pollution imposes significant health costs on the urban community globally, today's published data on pollution concentrations is spatially too sparse, and does not allow for sufficiently accurate estimation of exposures for (potentially mobile) individuals in order to make medical inferences. The HazeWatch project described in this paper uses several low-cost mobile sensor units attached to vehicles to measure air pollution concentrations, and users' mobile phones to tag and upload the data in real time. The greater spatial granularity of data thus collected enables creation of pollution maps of metropolitan Sydney viewable in real-time over the web, as well as personalized apps that show the individual's exposure history and allow for route planning to reduce future exposure. We share the insights we obtained from building and trialling such a system in Sydney, and highlight challenges that can be addressed collaboratively by groups developing similar systems world-wide.},

On the other hand, while travelling in buses, higher concentration of CO and NO2 were observed during the morning and evening periods due to the peaking traffic flow. On contrary O3 concentration was found to be highest during afternoon due to photochemical reactions.},

  abstract = {Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) data of similar continuously monitored species at two air monitoring sites with different characteristics within the City of Toronto were used to gauge the intra-city variations in the PM composition over a largely concurrent period spanning two years. One location was {$<$}8~m from the side of a major highway while the other was an urban background location. For the first time, multi-time resolution factor analysis was applied to dispersion-normalized concentrations to identify and quantify source contributions while reducing the influence of local meteorology. These factors were particulate sulphate (pSO4), particulate nitrate (pNO3), secondary organic aerosols (SOA), crustal matter (CrM) that were common to both sites, a hydrocarbon-like organic matter (HOM) exclusive to the urban background site, three black carbon related factors (BC, BC-HOM at the highway site, and a brown carbon rich factor (BC-BrC) at the urban background site), biomass burning organic matter (BBOM) and brake dust (BD) factors exclusive to the highway site. The PM2.5 composition was different between these two locations, over only a 10~km distance. The sum of SOA, pSO4 and pNO3 at the urban background site averaged 57\% of the PM2.5 mass while the same species represented 43\% of the average PM2.5 mass at the highway site. Local or site-specific factors may be of greater interest for control policy design. Thus, regression analyses with potential explanatory, site-specific variables were performed for results from the highway site. Three model approaches were explored: multiple linear regression (MLR), regression with a generalized reduced gradient (GRG) algorithm, and a generalized additive model (GAM). GAM gave the largest fraction of variance for the locally-found factors at the highway site. Heavy-duty vehicles were most important for explaining the black carbon (BC and BC-HOM) factors. Light-duty vehicles were dominant for the brake dust (BD) factor. The auxiliary modelling for the local factors showed that the traffic-related factors likely originated along the main roadways at their respective sites while the more regional factors, - pSO4, pNO3, SOA, - had sources that were both regional and local in origin and with contributions that varied seasonally. These results will be useful in understanding ambient particulate matter sources on a city scale that will support air quality management planning.},

  abstract = {Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) plays an important role in the application of environmental monitoring. Mostly air pollution being major issues as cause many hazardous effects on ecological system of human being. Therefore the need of monitoring air pollution around the city and the public transport buses and cars are very important problem today. Basically, environmental monitoring methods have difficulties in wired sensor network but by using WSN it is possible to achieve the challenging issues by implementing internet/intranet. This proposed research concentrates on measuring the gas level of air contamination around the cities and reduces the man power and also increases the overall flexibility of sender and receiver. The main objective of the proposed system for the moving vehicles is monitor the NO2, Humidity, Temperature, CO levels of air contamination by using NO2 sensor, Humidity sensor, Temperature sensor, CO sensor. In our proposed work MANET(Mobile Ad Hoc Network) routing algorithm is used which has nearly 28 mobile nodes(Vehicles) provide a coverage area of 300 meters around the city. The sensor data of the vehicles will be sent to the smart phones of the appropriate drivers to monitor effectively. The result of the proposed method includes the following parameters such as data type, speed of transmission, coverage of system, coverage area size, and No.of vehicles to closely monitor the proposed system.},

  abstract = {Oil and gas production in the Western United States has increased considerably over the past 10 years. While many of the still limited oil and gas impact assessments have focused on potential human health impacts, the typically remote locations of production in the Intermountain West suggests that the impacts of oil and gas production on national parks and wilderness areas (Class I and II areas) could also be important. To evaluate this, we utilize the Comprehensive Air quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) with a year-long modeling episode representing the best available representation of 2011 meteorology and emissions for the Western United States. The model inputs for the 2011 episodes were generated as part of the Three State Air Quality Study (3SAQS). The study includes a detailed assessment of oil and gas (O\&G) emissions in Western States. The year-long modeling episode was run both with and without emissions from O\&G production. The difference between these two runs provides an estimate of the contribution of the O\&G production to air quality. These data were used to assess the contribution of O\&G to the 8 hour average ozone concentrations, daily and annual fine particulate concentrations, annual nitrogen deposition totals and visibility in the modeling domain. We present the results for the Class I and II areas in the Western United States. Modeling results suggest that emissions from O\&G activity are having a negative impact on air quality and ecosystem health in our National Parks and Class I areas.Implications: In this research, we use a modeling framework developed for oil and gas evaluation in the western United States to determine the modeled impacts of emissions associated with oil and gas production on air pollution metrics. We show that oil and gas production may have a significant negative impact on air quality and ecosystem health in some national parks and other Class I areas in the western United States. Our findings are of particular interest to federal land managers as well as regulators in states heavy in oil and gas production as they consider control strategies to reduce the impact of development.},

However, despite its strong influence on cycling behavior, cyclists' exposure to traffic-related air pollution has been often disregarded. To close this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive bikeability index that comprises four sub-indices: accessibility, suitability, perceptibility, and prevailing air quality in the vicinity of cycling routes. We evaluate cyclists' exposure to fine particulate matter and black carbon, and used open-source data, land-use regression models, deep neural networks and spatial analysis. The application of the proposed bikeability framework reveals that the inclusion of air quality makes a significant difference when calculating bikeability index in Singapore and hence it merits serious consideration. We believe that the newly developed framework will convince city planners to consider the importance of assessing cyclists' exposure to airborne particles when planning cycling infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Citizens in urban areas are exposed to multiple environmental stressors like noise, heat, and air pollution, with impact on human health. There is a great deal of evidence that connects human health, objective environmental exposure, and place of residence. However, little is known about subjective and objective multiple personal exposures while being mobile. To address this research gap, this paper presents results from a mixed-methods exploratory study with cyclists in the City of Leipzig, Germany. In the summer of 2017, cyclists (n = 66) wore a unique combination of sensors that measured particle number counts (PNC), noise, humidity, temperature, geolocation, and the subjective perception of each exposure on everyday routes for one week (n = 730). A smartphone application was developed to question participants about their perception of subjective exposure. The data were analyzed with three aims: (i) to compare the multiple exposure profiles of the cyclists, (ii) to contrast the objective data and subjective individual perception, and (iii) to examine the role of route decision-making and awareness of health impacts for healthier route choices. The results indicate distinct differences between the exposure profiles of cyclists. Over 80\% of the cyclists underestimated their exposure to noise and air pollution. Except for heat, no significant associations between the objective and subjective data were found. This reveals an exposure awareness gap that needs to be considered in urban health planning and risk communication. It is argued that knowledge about health impacts and route characteristics plays a crucial role in decision-making about route choices. The paper concludes with suggestions to harness smart sensing for exposure mitigation and research in health geography.},

  abstract = {Visualizations are influential in the interaction between environmental science and policy. Research on framing in environmental visualizations (visual framing) is expanding. These studies typically focus on `static' images; the visualizations themselves. However, framing already occurs during their production through the choices made by their producers, and visualizations may be reframed while traveling across boundaries between science, policy and society. So far, visual framing during the production process and reframing during their circulation remains relatively unexplored and undertheorized, a gap which the current research aims to address. As an empirical case, we studied visualizations produced by a boundary organization, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL). We conducted interviews, focus groups, and a media-analysis. Our results show that although producers of visualizations were aware of potential framing through the objects depicted or simplifications in data, they were less aware of conceptual and ideological levels of visual framing and potential reframing when their visualizations circulate. Visual framing during production involved trade-offs in clarity, correctness and relevance, and contrasting perspectives among producers on intended audiences. When visualizations circulated, they were republished by multiple audiences and modified in various ways such as adjusting color, form and aggregating data. These reproductions and modifications resulted in different and contrasting frames compared to the original images. We demonstrate that environmental visualizations are powerful framing devices that can easily transcend the boundaries between science, policy and society. We thus highlight the need for boundary organizations to acknowledge visual framing effects in influencing these science-policy-society interactions.},

The use of stationary measurements at a limited number of locations to build a LUR model, however, can lead to an overestimation of its predictive abilities. We use opportunistic mobile monitoring to gather data at a high spatial resolution to build LUR models to predict annual average concentrations of black carbon (BC). The models explain a significant part of the variance in BC concentrations. However, the overall predictive performance remains low, due to input uncertainty and lack of predictive variables that can properly capture the complex characteristics of local concentrations. We stress the importance of using an appropriate cross-validation scheme to estimate the predictive performance of the model. By using independent data for the validation and excluding those data also during variable selection in the model building procedure, overly optimistic performance estimates are avoided.},

  abstract = {Mobile monitoring is increasingly used as an additional tool to acquire air quality data at a high spatial resolution. However, given the high temporal variability of urban air quality, a limited number of mobile measurements may only represent a snapshot and not be representative. In this study, the impact of this temporal variability on the representativeness is investigated and a methodology to map urban air quality using mobile monitoring is developed and evaluated. A large set of black carbon (BC) measurements was collected in Antwerp, Belgium, using a bicycle equipped with a portable BC monitor (micro-aethalometer). The campaign consisted of 256 and 96 runs along two fixed routes (2 and 5~km long). Large gradients over short distances and differences up to a factor of 10 in mean BC concentrations aggregated at a resolution of 20~m are observed. Mapping at such a high resolution is possible, but a lot of repeated measurements are required. After computing a trimmed mean and applying background normalisation, depending on the location 24\textendash 94 repeated measurement runs (median of 41) are required to map the BC concentrations at a 50~m resolution with an uncertainty of 25\%. When relaxing the uncertainty to 50\%, these numbers reduce to 5\textendash 11 (median of 8) runs. We conclude that mobile monitoring is a suitable approach for mapping the urban air quality at a high spatial resolution, and can provide insight into the spatial variability that would not be possible with stationary monitors. A careful set-up is needed with a sufficient number of repetitions in relation to the desired reliability and spatial resolution. Specific data processing methods such as background normalisation and event detection have to be applied.},

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to explore the potential of opportunistic mobile monitoring to map the exposure to air pollution in the urban environment at a high spatial resolution. Opportunistic mobile monitoring makes use of existing mobile infrastructure or people's common daily routines to move measurement devices around. Opportunistic mobile monitoring can also play a crucial role in participatory monitoring campaigns as a typical way to gather data. A case study to measure black carbon was set up in Antwerp, Belgium, with the collaboration of city employees (city wardens). The Antwerp city wardens are outdoors for a large part of the day on surveillance tours by bicycle or on foot, and gathered a total of 393~h of measurements. The data collection is unstructured both in space and time, leading to sampling bias. A temporal adjustment can only partly counteract this bias. Although a high spatial coverage was obtained, there is still a rather large uncertainty on the average concentration levels at a spatial resolution of 50~m due to a limited number of measurements and sampling bias. Despite of this uncertainty, large spatial patterns within the city are clearly captured. This study illustrates the potential of campaigns with unstructured opportunistic mobile monitoring, including participatory monitoring campaigns. The results demonstrate that such an approach can indeed be used to identify broad spatial trends over a wider area, enabling applications including hotspot identification, personal exposure studies, regression mapping, etc. But, they also emphasize the need for repeated measurements and careful processing and interpretation of the data.},

In urban environments, on-road black carbon concentrations have a large spatial variability, suggesting that the personal exposure of a cyclist to black carbon can heavily depend on the route that is chosen to reach a destination. In this paper, we describe the development of a cyclist routing procedure that minimizes personal exposure to black carbon. Firstly, a land use regression model for predicting black carbon concentrations in an urban environment is developed using mobile monitoring data, collected by cyclists. The optimal model is selected and validated using a spatially stratified cross-validation scheme. The resulting model is integrated in a dedicated routing procedure that minimizes personal exposure to black carbon during cycling. The best model obtains a coefficient of multiple correlation of R=0.520. Simulations with the black carbon exposure minimizing routing procedure indicate that the inhaled amount of black carbon is reduced by 1.58\% on average as compared to the shortest-path route, with extreme cases where a reduction of up to 13.35\% is obtained. Moreover, we observed that the average exposure to black carbon and the exposure to local peak concentrations on a route are competing objectives, and propose a parametrized cost function for the routing problem that allows for a gradual transition from routes that minimize average exposure to routes that minimize peak exposure.},

This station has recorded the highest CO and NOx concentrations during recent years in the region of Paris. Diffusive BTX samplers as well as a mobile monitoring unit equipped with real-time CO, NOx and O3 analysers and meteorological instruments were used to reveal the small-scale pollution gradients and their temporal trends near the permanent monitoring station. The diffusive measurements provided 7-day averages of benzene, toluene, xylene and other hydrocarbons at different heights above the ground and distances from the kerb covering summer and winter periods. Relevant traffic and meteorological data were also obtained on an hourly basis. Furthermore, three semi-empirical dispersion models (STREET-SRI, OSPM and AEOLIUS) were tested for an asymmetric canyon location in Av. Leclerc. The analysis of this comprehensive data set has helped to assess the representativeness of air quality monitoring information.},

However, the power to assess a relationship at very low concentrations of PM(10) has been limited in studies to date. The concentrations of PM(10) and other air pollutants in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, from January 1994 through December 1996 were very low: the 50th and 90th percentiles of daily average PM(10) concentrations were 13 and 23 micro g/m(3), respectively, and 27 and 39 ppb, respectively, for 1-hr maximum ozone. Analyses of 3 years of daily pollution (PM(10), ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide) concentrations and mortality counts showed that the dominant associations were between ozone and total mortality and respiratory and cardiovascular mortality in the summer, and between nitrogen dioxide and total mortality in the winter, although some association with PM(10) may also have been present. We conclude that increases in low concentrations of air pollution are associated with increased daily mortality. These findings may support the notion that no threshold pollutant concentrations are present, but they also raise concern that these effects may not be effects of the measured pollutants themselves, but rather of some other factor(s) present in the air pollution-meteorology mix.},

Here we assess an array of modern air pollution exposure estimation approaches for assigning within-city exposure estimates in Beijing for individual pollutants and pollutant sources to individual members of a cohort. Issues considered in selecting specific monitoring data or new monitoring campaigns include: needed spatial resolution, exposure measurement error and its impact on health effect estimates, spatial alignment and compatibility with the cohort, and feasibility and expense. Sources of existing data largely include administrative monitoring data, predictions from air dispersion or chemical transport models and remote sensing (specifically satellite) data. New air monitoring campaigns include additional fixed site monitoring, snapshot monitoring, passive badge or micro-sensor saturation monitoring and mobile monitoring, as well as combinations of these. Each of these has relative advantages and disadvantages. It is concluded that a campaign in Beijing that at least includes a mobile monitoring component, when coupled with currently available spatio-temporal modeling methods, should be strongly considered. Such a campaign is economical and capable of providing the desired fine-scale spatial resolution for pollutants and sources.},

  abstract = {Air pollution in urban centres is increasing, with burgeoning population and increased traffic and industry. The detrimental impact on population health has been the focus of many epidemiological studies. Some cities are fortunate to have one, or at most a few, sparsely spaced fixed air quality monitors, which provide much needed daily data. However, fixed monitors do not accurately depict the spatial distribution of air pollution over the extent of an urban area nor can they target areas for focused surveys. We have used mobile monitoring to improve spatial coverage of pollution concentrations over the city of Hamilton, Ontario and to enhance our knowledge of the short-term bursts of pollution to which the population is exposed. Mobile surveys have been carried out in the city of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada since 2005. Results for two pollutants, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) representing traffic sources, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) representing industry sources, are presented. The data demonstrate very high levels of NOx exceeding 600 ppb, near major highways with SO2 levels up to 249 ppb near industrial sources. Both values significantly exceed the hourly maxima recorded by fixed monitors. The results also highlight the effect of wind direction on SO2 and NOx levels, and the affected population in each scenario.},

Two statistical models were utilized to apportion the sources of pollution impacting this site and the denizens of the nearby neighborhoods. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was performed on the organic signal of the aerosol mass spectra, resulting in five factors totaling an average of 4.1~{$\mu$}g/m3 of the organic aerosol: hydrocarbon-like (0.67~{$\mu$}g/m3), cooking (0.35~{$\mu$}g/m3) biomass burning (1.14~{$\mu$}g/m3), low-volatility oxidized (1.15~{$\mu$}g/m3), and semi-volatile oxidized (0.78~{$\mu$}g/m3). Principal component analysis was performed on daytime and nighttime data, including concentrations from PMF output, of other PM1 components, and of trace gases. This generated five daytime and five nighttime factors that explained 74.5\% and 73.0\% of the variance, respectively. The most important factors impacting this site were from mobile source exhaust and petrochemical aromatic compound emissions. Together these two factors also constitute most of the observed carcinogens.},

The city is divided by a 90-m high topographic scarp, the Niagara Escarpment, and dissected by valleys which open towards Lake Ontario. Temperature inversions occur frequently in the cooler seasons, exacerbating the impact of emissions from industry and traffic. This study used pollution data gathered from mobile monitoring surveys conducted over a 3-year period, to investigate whether the effects of the inversions varied across the city. Temperature inversions were identified with vertical temperature data from a meteorological tower located within the study area. We divided the study area into an upper and lower zone separated by the Escarpment and further into six zones, based on location with respect to the Escarpment and industrial and residential areas, to explore variations across the city. The results identified clear differences in the responses of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) to temperature inversions, based on the topographic and spatial criteria. We found that pollution levels increased as the inversion strengthened, in the lower city. However, the results also suggested that temperature inversions identified in the lower city were not necessarily experienced in the upper city with the same intensity. Further, pollution levels in the upper city appeared to decrease as the inversion deepened in the lower city, probably because of an associated change in prevailing wind direction and lower wind speeds, leading to decreased long-range transport of pollutants.},

Major chemical components in PM2.5, including water-soluble ions, metal elements, and organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) were determined. The chemical mass closure method and the ISORROPIA II thermodynamic equilibrium model were used to reconstruct PM2.5 mass and quantify the combinations of NH4+, SO42- and NO3- to PM2.5. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was employed to apportion potential sources of PM2.5. The annual average PM2.5 concentration was 93.7{$\pm$}49.6{$\mu$}gm-3 at the suburban petrochemical industrial site and 88.9{$\pm$}52.0{$\mu$}gm-3 at the urban site, with the highest seasonal average in winter and the lowest in summer at both sites. Mineral dust was identified as the highest contributor to PM2.5 in spring, while water-soluble inorganic ions and carbonaceous aerosols were the dominant chemical components in other seasons. The correlation relationships between OC and EC and between K+ and EC suggested that coal combustion and vehicle exhaust were the major sources of carbonaceous aerosols in Lanzhou. Six major sources were identified by the PMF model. Coal combustion, soil dust, traffic emissions, and secondary inorganic aerosols were the dominant contributors, together accounting for 82\% of PM2.5 mass.},

Site-specific seven-year mean gravimetric PM2.5 mass concentrations ranged from 5.7 to 9.6 \textmu g/m3. Seven-year mean concentrations of SO42-, NO3-, NH4+, organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC) were in the range of 0.68 to 1.6, 0.21 to 1.5, 0.27 to 0.71, 1.1 to 1.9, and 0.37 to 0.71 \textmu g /m3, accounting for 10.8\%-18.1\%, 3.7\%-16.7\%, 4.7\%-7.4\%, 18.4\%-21.0\%, and 6.4\%-10.6\%, respectively, of gravimetric PM2.5 mass. PM2.5 and its five major chemical components showed higher concentrations in southeastern Canada and lower values in Atlantic Canada, with the seven-year mean ratios between the two regions being on the order of 1.7 for PM2.5 and 1.8-7.1 for its chemical components. When comparing the concentrations between urban and rural sites within the same region, those of SO42- and NH4+ were comparable, while those of NO3-, OC, and EC were around 20\%, 40\%-50\%, and 70\%-80\%, respectively, higher at urban than rural sites, indicating the regional scale impacts of SO42- and NH4+ and effects of local sources on OC and EC. Monthly variations generally showed summertime peaks for SO42- and wintertime peaks for NO3-, but those of NH4+, OC, and EC exhibited different seasonality at different locations.},

The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson's grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical ``poems.''

Two vehicles with identical makes and models of UFP and BC monitors as well as GPS receivers were sampled within 140 m of each other for 2 h in total during winter in Seattle, Washington. To identify an optimal intervehicle distance for rendezvous calibration, 6 different buffers within 0\textendash 140 m for UFP monitors and 5 different buffers within 0\textendash 90 m for BC monitors were chosen, and the results of calibration were compared against a reference scenario, which consisted of mobile colocation measurements with both sets of the UFP and BC monitors deployed in one of the vehicles. Results indicate that the optimal distances for rendezvous calibration are 10\textendash 80 m for UFP monitors and 0\textendash 30 m for BC monitors. In comparison with the mobile colocation calibration, the rendezvous calibration shows a normalized root mean squared deviation of 6\textendash 14\% and a normalized mean absolute deviation of 4\textendash 8\% for these monitors. Criteria for applying a rendezvous calibration approach are presented, and an extension of this approach to an instrumented fleet of mobile monitoring vehicles is discussed.},

Few studies have explored the performance of independently developed daytime/nighttime LUR models. In this study, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particulate matter (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations were measured by mobile monitoring during non-heating and heating seasons in Taiyuan. Pollutant concentrations were higher in the nighttime than the daytime, and higher in the heating season than the non-heating season. Daytime/nighttime and full-day LUR models were developed and validated for each pollutant to examine variations in model performance. Adjusted coefficients of determination (adjusted R2) for the LUR models ranged from 0.53\textendash 0.87 (PM2.5), 0.53\textendash 0.85 (PM10), and 0.33\textendash 0.67 (NO2). The performance of the daytime/nighttime LUR models for PM2.5 and PM10 was better than that of the full-day models according to the results of model adjusted R2 and validation R2. Consistent results were confirmed in the non-heating and heating seasons. Effectiveness of developing independent daytime/nighttime models for NO2 to improve performance was limited. Surfaces based on the daytime/nighttime models revealed variations in concentrations and spatial distribution. In conclusion, the independent development of daytime/nighttime LUR models for PM2.5/PM10 has the potential to replace full-day models for better model performance. The modeling strategy is consistent with the residential activity patterns and contributes to achieving reliable exposure predictions for PM2.5 and PM10. Nighttime could be a critical exposure period, due to high pollutant concentrations.},

Perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethanols/sulfonamides (FOSE/As) were detected at low frequencies ({$<$}30\%). In addition to partitioning to organic moiety, specific adsorption onto mineral particles can be important for PFASs to bind onto outdoor dust, especially for short-chain ionizable PFASs. The eastern plain areas were characterized by a higher contribution of long-chain ionizable PFASs; whereas the western high plateau areas were characterized by the dominating contribution of short-chain analogues. The difference suggests that the long-range atmospheric transport potential of PFASs from source regions to the inland is probably limited by the increase in altitude, and different sources from adjacent regions may influence the western border area of China.},

Urban activity was related to high levels of neutral PFASs at Tianjin while perfluorooctanoic carboxylic acid (PFOA) was dominant in the atmosphere at Weifang, possibly due to industrial sources.

PFASs profiles at NHI suggested direct atmospheric transport of neutral and ionic PFASs from source regions. Temperature-dependent partitioning of fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) was observed in winter, when total concentrations and particle-phase fractions of FTOHs were significantly higher as compared to those in summer. Correlation analyses suggested more active gas-phase degradation of FTOHs in summer and likely heterogeneous degradation in both seasons. Overall, it is necessary to account for ionic PFASs in both gas and particle phases and particulate matter was important for atmospheric transport and for determining the fate of PFASs, especially in areas close to a source region.},

Traditionally, urban air quality is measured by networks of stationary monitors that are not universally available and sparsely sited. Mobile air quality monitoring using equipped vehicles is a promising alternative but has focused on vehicle-level experiments and lacks fleet-level demonstration. Here, we equipped 260 electric vehicles in a ride-hailing fleet in Beijing, China with low-cost sensors to collect real-time, spatial-resolved data on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. Using this data, we developed a decision tree model to infer the distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing at 1 km by 1 km and 1 h resolution. Our results are able to show both short- and long-term variations of urban PM2.5 concentrations and identify local air pollution hotspots. Compared with a benchmark model that only uses data from stationary monitoring sits, our model has shown significant improvement with the coefficient of determination increased from 0.56 to 0.80 and root mean square error decreased from 12.6 to 8.1 {$\mu$}g/m3. To the best of our knowledge, this study collects the largest mobile sensor data for urban air quality monitoring, which are augmented by state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to derive high-quality urban air pollution mapping. Our results demonstrate the potential and necessity of using fleet vehicles as routine mobile sensors combined with advanced data science methods to provide high-resolution urban air quality monitoring.},

However, previous studies were less to test the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of on-road PM2.5 and its related factors at micro scale. To this end, collecting high-resolution PM2.5 data by mobile monitoring along different roads in Guangzhou, China, this paper explored the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the relationship between built environment and on-road PM2.5 during the morning (7\textendash 9 am) and evening (7\textendash 9\,pm) rush hours. Semi-variogram method and geographically weighted regression (GWR) model were utilized to reveal the non-stationarity associations among the large spatial dataset. In terms of temporal heterogeneity, the results showed that the spatial independent radii of on-road PM2.5 were 17\,m and 21\,m for morning and evening rush hours respectively. The aggregated median value of PM2.5 in the morning rush hours was 34.95\,{$\mu$}g/m3, while the evening was up to 55.49\,{$\mu$}g/m3. There were more significant factors of street conditions impact on on-road PM2.5 in the morning while more significant factors of land use and centrality that reflecting the cumulative effect of daily human activities with smaller buffer thresholds in the evening. In terms of spatial heterogeneity, GWR models achieved much better performance than the global ones of multivariate regression models with lower AICc, RMSE and higher adjusted R2, explaining 10\textendash 69\% of variance across different roads and rush hours. There was a high degree of spatial heterogeneity that the leading factors were different along various roads on rush hours. The results indicated that the policies and interventions should be more targeted to improve the on-road air environment and reduce personal exposure according to the spatial-temporal geographical context. It can be adopted to provide more realistic and practical guides for urban planning and environmental pollution control.},

  abstract = {Background The relationship between traffic emissions and mobile-source air pollutant concentrations is highly variable over space and time and therefore difficult to model accurately, especially in urban settings with complex terrain. Regression-based approaches using continuous real-time mobile measurements may be able to characterize spatiotemporal variability in traffic-related pollutant concentrations but require methods to incorporate temporally varying meteorology and source strength in a physically interpretable fashion. Objective We developed a statistical model to assess the joint impact of both meteorology and traffic on measured concentrations of mobile-source air pollutants over space and time. Methods In this study, traffic-related air pollutants were continuously measured in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York (USA), which is affected by traffic on a large bridge and major highway. One-minute average concentrations of ultrafine particulate matter (UFP), fine particulate matter [{$\leq$} 2.5 {$\mu$}m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5)], and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were measured using a mobile-monitoring protocol. Regression modeling approaches to quantify the influence of meteorology, traffic volume, and proximity to major roadways on pollutant concentrations were used. These models incorporated techniques to capture spatial variability, long- and short-term temporal trends, and multiple sources. Results We observed spatial heterogeneity of both UFP and PM2.5 concentrations. A variety of statistical methods consistently found a 15\textendash 20\% decrease in UFP concentrations within the first 100 m from each of the two major roadways. For PM2.5, temporal variability dominated spatial variability, but we observed a consistent linear decrease in concentrations from the roadways. Conclusions The combination of mobile monitoring and regression analysis was able to quantify local source contributions relative to background while accounting for physically interpretable parameters. Our results provide insight into urban exposure gradients.},
