Today we will be focusing on the theory of data visualization.

## Chartjunk

Chart Junk is a term first used by Edward Tufte in his book _The Quantitative Display of Visual Information_. He defined it as:

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
The interior decoration of graphics generates a lot of ink that does not tell the viewer anything new.  The purpose of decoration varies-to make the graphic appear more scientific and precise, to enliven the display, to give the designer an opportunity to exercise artistic skills. Regardless of its cause it is all non-data-ink or redundant data-ink, and it is often chartjunk.

In other words, Tufte believes that embellishment, decoration, and ornamentation is typically bad in a data visualization. While I can talk about this, it is better to just show examples of chartjunk.

Just do an image search for _chartjunk_ in your browser. Here's a few examples.

@fig-Mario shows a very simple bar chart with lots of colors, patterns, and

@fig-Diamonds shows a price line chart embellished with a decorative reclining lady. This is what Tufte calls a **Duck** - elevating design over data.

@fig-MentalHealth shows a pie chart of video analysis by medical professionals. Only three values are shown, yet there is a flourish of colors, cartoons, clipart, and embellishment.

Tufte was pretty crufty about anything that was not minimalist. He is an pro-modernist design and anti-baroque design.  And there is some research that suggests more ornamented and interesting visualizations stick with people longer than minimal designs.

## Data-Ink Ratios

The second Tufte-ism is the ratio of data-ink. This is a quantitative measure indicating the amount of 'ink' used to convey data/information in a visualization. Any 'ink' not conveying information is considered superfluous and redundant.

A simple example from the tidyverse would be to compare the default theme for a `ggplot()` with `theme_bw()` or `theme_minimal()`. 

Here's [Figure 5-2](http://radicalresearch.llc/EDVcourse/maps2.html#fig-ggBasic) with the default theme. Notice all that background 'ink' in gray. 

Tufte would definitely prefer [Figure 5-5](http://radicalresearch.llc/EDVcourse/maps2.html#fig-ggMinimal) where we removed all that background and even the frame around the outside of the map.

This is an aesthetic preference, especially in the modern era where almost all of the visualization we engage with is on a computer/tablet/phone. There is no amount of pixel-ink that is consumed. And in some cases the brightness of a white background may be antithetical and harmful, such as in the ProPublica Sacrifice Zone visualizations as shown in [Figure 17.2](http://radicalresearch.llc/EDVcourse/sacrifice.html#fig-proPublica).

## What makes a map in `leaflet` bad?

Most of the teams are using `leaflet` maps.  What things in `leaflet` look bad and don't work?

## Class Exercise - work on group visualization

Here's a framework for the final group visualization from the [Junk Charts Blog](https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/junk-charts-trifecta-checkup-the-definitive-guide.html)

- What is the practical question?
- What does the data you have say about the question?
- What do the individual visualizations say?

I would add:

- Who is the audience for the visualization?
