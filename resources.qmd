# Resources {#sec-appendix-resources}

Base R is the collection of functions that come preloaded with R.  A function is a code block that performs a task. Functions that come in R are in-built functions. However, the real power of R (and programming languages more generally) are the large number of user-built functions that are built to perform tasks that can be loaded into base R.

Sets of functions that have a common purpose are bundled together in R in "packages". There are literally thousands of packages custom-built for R.  

During this course, I will ask you to use some important packages for data acquisition, tidying, and visualization. There are two steps to using a package in R.

First, it needs to be installed. Here's a non-functional example.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: false

install.packages('<PACKAGE.NAME>')


```

And this example will install an actual package called `janitor`. This package features a nice import function that fixes column names on import called clean_names().

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| eval: false

install.packages('janitor')

```

In a meta way, you now have used a function to install a package. 'install.package()' is an example of an in-built R function.  

Once a package is installed, it needs to be loaded.  While the installation has put the package on your computer, you need to tell R that it should load these functions for use.  

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
R and other programming languages only do EXACTLY what they are told to do. 
:::

Loading a package is accomplished by calling base R `library` function. Success is indicated with a message like "Attaching package: 'janitor'

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(janitor)
```

Libraries have to be loaded each time you restart your R session. The current libraries loaded can be founded in the file manager panel under the `Packages` tab.
