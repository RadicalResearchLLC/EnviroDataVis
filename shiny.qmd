## `Shiny`

[`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package that is used to build interactive web apps. In the modern day, it is useful to be able to build visualizations that others can view on the internet(s).

I will show you how to build a simple web app using the SoCalEJ dataset today.

First, we install `shiny`.

```{r}
#| label: install shiny
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| eval: false

install.packages('shiny')
```

Second, we restart RStudio so that the shiny template is loaded into RStudio.

Close and restart RStudio!

Three, we load some libraries.

```{r}
#| label: load libraries
#| echo: true
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(shiny)
library(sf)
library(leaflet)

```

## Prepare the dataset

For most apps, we want to prepare the dataset for display. While we can technically do all the import and munging in `shiny` within an app, it is often better to do the pre-processing of data first, as it will improve the app performance to not have to download data and munge it to make a figure.

We will acquire and tidy the SoCalEJ dataset we've used many times.

Acquire the data - same as in [Section 9.1](http://radicalresearch.llc/EDVcourse/EJdata.html#load-and-import-steps)

```{r}
#| label: import SoCalEJ dataset again
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

URL.path <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RadicalResearchLLC/EDVcourse/main/CalEJ4/CalEJ.geoJSON'
SoCalEJ <- st_read(URL.path) %>% 
  st_transform("+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84")

```

Tidy the data by transforming it from a wide to a narrow dataset - much the same as in [Section 9.3](http://radicalresearch.llc/EDVcourse/EJdata.html#load-and-import-steps).

```{r}
#| label: transform dataset from wide to narrow
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# select indicators and make them narrow - we remove geometry because it 
# duplicates geometry in the pivot
SoCal_narrow1 <- SoCalEJ %>% 
  st_set_geometry(value = NULL) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(5:66), names_to = 'variable', values_to = 'value') %>% 
  filter(value >=0)

head(SoCal_narrow1, 5)

# Select census tracts and geometry

SoCal_geometry <- SoCalEJ %>% 
  select(Tract, geometry)

head(SoCal_geometry, 5)

# Join narrow data and geometry again - this adds the geometry back in for the map

SoCal_narrow <- SoCal_narrow1 %>% 
  left_join(SoCal_geometry) %>%   
  #this fixes the dataset to 
  st_as_sf() %>% 
  #standard projection transformation.
  st_transform("+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84")

head(SoCal_narrow, 5)

# remove interim dataframes to optimize dataset management
rm(ls = SoCal_geometry, SoCalEJ)
```

Last data processing step is to create a list of variables and arrange them alphabetically. Use `select()` to keep only the variable, `distinct()` to keep only one instance of each variable, and `arrange()` to order them.

```{r}
#| label: create list of variables
#| echo: true

list <- SoCal_narrow1 %>% 
  select(variable) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(variable)

head(list, 10)
```

## Shiny time

### Resources on Shiny

[Tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) [Cheatsheet](https://shiny.rstudio.com/images/shiny-cheatsheet.pdf)

### Step 1 - New file - Shiny App

1.  Go to the **File** menu
2.  Select **New File**
3.  Select **Shiny Web App...**
4.  A window will pop up asking you to name the app - type **SoCalEJ**
5.  Press the **Create** button

@fig-menuShiny shows where to go.

![New Shiny App from the menu](images/shinyApp.png){#fig-menuShiny}

### Step 2 - Shiny App Default Template

A new file called **app.R** should open. The default app.R template is a functional app.

Press **Run App** as shown in @fig-runApp .

![Run app button is here](images/runApp.png){#fig-runApp}

When you press the button, an App called 'Old Faithful Geyser Data' appears. The slider input is interactive, allowing the user to choose the number of histogram bins.

Let's hear a Whoot if this worked for you.

Close the app (not minimize!) by pressing the STOP button in RStudio or closing the app window.

### Step 3 - Modify the app.

We are going to change things one at a time. Debugging shiny apps is even harder than normal R code.

#### Change the title

Let's change the title first. Currently it is: `titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),`

Replace the existing line 16 with the new title.

```{r}
#| label: replace title
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

titlePanel("SoCal Enviroscreen App"),

```

#### Replace `sliderInput()` with `selectInput()`

While `sliderInput()` is great for numbers, it is not useful for selecting categorical variables like the SoCalEJ dataset contains.

Replace **code lines 21-25** with a `selectInput()` shown below. This creates a dropdown menu. We will design it to allow the user to select the variable of interest `list$variable` and the default selection `DieselPM_P`.

However, it will also break the figure below. That's ok because we're going to replace it in the next two steps.

```{r}
#| label: replace input
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

    selectInput(inputId = 'metric',
      label = 'Pick a metric',
      choices = list$variable, 
      selected = 'DieselPM_P')
```

@fig-brokenApp displays the output when running the app after this change.

![Broken figure dropdown version](images/appBroke.png){#fig-brokenApp}
  
#### Change the histogram output to **SoCal_narrow1** data

Let's make a working figure. A histogram is fine as an example, but we'll do a ggplot following the style of [Figure 9.8](http://radicalresearch.llc/EDVcourse/EJdata.html#fig-histoPretty).

Let's use that code chunk from Lecture 9 as the basis for our new figure. The one thing we need to do is `filter()` the variable based on the user input. The user selected `input$metric` takes the selection from the dropdown menu and reacts whenever the user picks a different option. So instead of using a `filter` on a named variable like **DieselPM_P**, we have a reactive variable which the user can modify through the dropdown menu.

We need to replace the original histogram output from lines 39-45 to our slightly modified `ggplot` code from Figure 9.8.

```{r}
#| label: replace output
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

      # dataset is SoCal_narrow1
      SoCal_narrow1 %>% 
        # filter based on the input$metric
        filter(variable == input$metric)  %>% 
        #create a ggplot by county, value
        ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = County)) +
        geom_histogram() +
        theme_bw() +
        facet_wrap(~County) +
        labs(x = input$metric, 
             y = 'Count of census tracts') 
```

This whole code chunk exists within the **wrapper** of `output$distPlot <- renderPlot({})`. That part of the code doesn't have to change at all. That part of the code chunk tells the app to make a plot and render it in the app. The name of the plot is **distPlot**. The ui portion of the app on line 29 describes where it goes - in the main panel.

If this code chunk works for you, pressing **Run App** will generate a shiny app that has a reactive dropdown menu allowing you to create 50+ histograms. Shiny apps are amazingly powerful tools to generate the same plot N different ways.

#### Make it spatial with a `leaflet` interactive map.

Adding a map to an app is the capstone.

There's two parts to add.

1.  add `leafletOutput('map')` to the ui in the `mainPanel()`
2.  add `output$map <- renderLeaflet({CODE GOES HERE})` to the server.

First, let's do the ui part cause that is easy. On line 28 there is a code chunk that currently says `mainPanel(plotOutput("distPlot))`. Replace that with the code chunk below that puts in a comma and a `leafletOutput('map')`.

```{r}
#| label: edit the UI main panel
#| echo: true
#| eval: false


        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot"),
           leafletOutput("map")
        )

```

Next, we'll paste in a big old code chunk to insert a leaflet map. It has four parts.

1.  The **wrapper**
2.  A reactive table that only includes the selected metric.
3.  A reactive color palette
4.  A leaflet map

I'm just going to show it all at once and we'll diagram it within the app from innermost to outermost.

```{r}
#| label: Big reactive leaflet code chunk
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

output$map <- renderLeaflet({
      
      # filter geometry dataset for the user input
     metricSoCal <- SoCal_narrow %>% 
       filter(variable == input$metric) %>% 

      # Create a dynamic color palette based on the metric
     palM <- colorNumeric(palette = 'magma', 
        domain = metricSoCal$value)
      
        #This is the map - note that the legend title is dynamic
      leaflet(metricSoCal) %>% 
        addTiles() %>% 
        setView(lat = 33.8, lng = -117.60, zoom = 9) %>% 
        addPolygons(color = ~palM(value),
                    weight = 1) %>% 
        addLegend(pal = palM,
                  title = input$metric,
                  values = ~value)
    })
```
